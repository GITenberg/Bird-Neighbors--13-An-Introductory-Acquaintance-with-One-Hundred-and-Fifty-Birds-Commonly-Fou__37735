<div class="caption2">PREFACE</div>

<p>Not to have so much as a bowing acquaintance with the birds that nest
in our gardens or under the very eaves of our houses; that haunt our
wood-piles; keep our fruit-trees free from slugs; waken us with their
songs, and enliven our walks along the roadside and through the woods,
seems to be, at least, a breach of etiquette toward some of our most
kindly disposed neighbors.</p>

<p>Birds of prey, game and water birds are not included in the book. The
following pages are intended to be nothing more than a familiar
introduction to the birds that live near us. Even in the principal
park of a great city like New York, a bird-lover has found more than
one hundred and thirty species; as many, probably, as could be
discovered in the same sized territory anywhere.</p>

<p>The plan of the book is not a scientific one, if the term scientific
is understood to mean technical and anatomical. The purpose of the
writer is to give, in a popular and accessible form, knowledge which
is accurate and reliable about the life of our common birds. This
knowledge has not been collected from the stuffed carcasses of birds
in museums, but gleaned afield. In a word, these short narrative
descriptions treat of the bird's characteristics of size, color, and
flight; its peculiarities of instinct and temperament; its nest and
home life; its choice of food; its songs; and of the season in which
we may expect it to play its part in the great panorama Nature unfolds
with faithful precision year after year. They are an attempt to make
the bird so live before the reader that, when seen out of doors, its
recognition shall be instant and cordial, like that given to a friend.</p>

<p>The coloring described in this book is sometimes more vivid than that
found in the works of some learned authorities whose conflicting
testimony is often sadly bewildering to the novice. In different parts
of the country, and at different seasons of the year, the plumage of
some birds undergoes many changes. The reader must remember,
therefore, that the specimens examined and described were not, as
before stated, the faded ones in our museums, but live birds in their
fresh, spring plumage, studied afield.</p>

<p>The birds have been classed into color groups, in the belief that this
method, more than any other will make identification most easy. The
color of the bird is the first, and often the only, characteristic
noticed. But they have also been classified according to the
localities for which they show decided preferences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
and in which they are most likely to be found. Again, they have been
grouped according to the season when they may be expected. In the
brief paragraphs that deal with groups of birds separated into the
various families represented in the book, the characteristics and
traits of each clan are clearly emphasized. By these several aids it
is believed the merest novice will be able to quickly identify any
bird neighbor that is neither local nor rare.</p>

<p>To the uninitiated or uninterested observer, all small, dull-colored
birds are "common sparrows." The closer scrutiny of the trained eye
quickly differentiates, and picks out not only the Song, the Canada,
and the Fox Sparrows, but finds a dozen other familiar friends where
one who "has eyes and sees not" does not even suspect their presence.
Ruskin says: "The more I think of it, I find this conclusion more
impressed upon me, that the greatest thing a human soul ever does in
this world is to <i>see</i> something. Hundreds of people can talk for one
who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see. To see
clearly is poetry, prophecy, and religion&mdash;all in one."</p>

<p>While the author is indebted to all the time-honored standard
authorities, and to many ornithologists of the present day&mdash;too many
for individual mention&mdash;it is to Mr. John Burroughs her deepest debt
is due. To this clear-visioned prophet, who has opened the blind eyes
of thousands to the delights that Nature holds within our easy reach,
she would gratefully acknowledge many obligations; first of all, for
the plan on which "Bird Neighbors" is arranged; next, for his patient
kindness in reading and annotating the manuscript of the book; and,
not least, for the inspiration of his perennially charming writings
that are so largely responsible for the ready-made audience now
awaiting writers on out-of-door topics.</p>

<div class="center">&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8226;</div>

<p>It is hoped that the illustrations in this edition of "Bird Neighbors"
will do much to add to the pleasure and profit of the reader. Through
the courtesy of the National Association of Audubon Societies, the
pictures painted by artists who are specialists in bird portraiture
embellish this book. Each portrait has been examined and corrected
when necessary by an authority. The birds are pictured as they are in
life, each according to its own habit of existence.</p>

<p>The author takes this opportunity to express her appreciation of the
work the National Association of Audubon Societies has done and is
doing to prevent the slaughter of birds in all parts of the United
States, to develop bird sanctuaries and inaugurate protective
legislation. Indeed to it, more than to all other agencies combined,
is due the credit of eliminating so much of the Prussian like cruelty
toward birds that once characterized American treatment of them, from
the rising generation.</p>

<div class="caption2">THE NATURE LIBRARY</div>

<div class="caption2">By JOHN BURROUGHS</div>

<p>I do not propose in these introductory remarks to this Nature Library
to discuss the merits or the character of the separate volumes further
than to say that they are all by competent hands and, so far as I can
judge, entirely reliable. While accurate and scientific, I have found
them very readable. The treatment is popular without being
sensational.</p>

<p>This library is free from the scientific dry rot on the one hand and
from the florid and misleading romanticism of much recent nature
writing on the other. It is a safe guide to the world of animal and
plant life that lies about us. And that is all the wise reader wants.
He should want to explore this world for himself. Indeed,
nature-study, as it appeals to us in books, fails of its chief end if
it does not send us to nature itself. What we want is not the mere
facts about the flowers or the animals&mdash;we want through them to add to
the resources of our lives; and I know of nothing better calculated to
do this than the study of nature at first hand. To add to the
resources of one's life&mdash;think how much that means! To add to those
things that make us more at home in the world; that help guard us
against ennui and stagnation; that invest the country with new
interest and enticement; that make every walk in the fields or woods
an excursion into a land of unexhausted treasures; that make the
returning seasons fill us with expectation and delight; that make
every rod of ground like the page of a book in which new and strange
things may be read; in short, those things that help keep us fresh and
sane and young, and make us immune to the strife and fever of the
world.</p>

<p>The main thing is to feel an interest in Nature&mdash;an interest that
leads to a loving unconscious study of her. Not entirely a scientific
interest, but a human interest as well; science upon the one hand and
an appreciation of the mystery, the beauty, and the bounty of life
upon the other. The child feels a human interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
in nature: when the
schoolgirls come to school with their hands full of wild flowers, or
the boys make excursions to the woods in May for wintergreens, or
black birch, or crinkle root, they are all moved by an interest that
is old and deep-seated in the race. Now, if to this interest and
curiosity we can add a little science, just enough to guide them, we
lift these feelings to another plane and give them a longer lease of
life. The boy will not be so likely to rob birds' nests after the
savage in him has been humanized by a touch of real knowledge and he
has come to look upon the bird as something worthy of naming and
studying and that has its place in the economy of the fields and
woods.</p>

<p>A touch of real knowledge&mdash;how humanizing and elevating it is! Simply
to learn that all the plants have been studied and named, even the
humblest; that they all have vital relations with one another&mdash;family
ties; that the great biological laws are operative in them also; that
the deep, mysterious principle of variation, which is at the bottom of
Darwin's theory of the origin of the species, is working in the
lowliest plant we tread upon; to know that the chain of cause and
effect runs through the whole organic world, binding together its
remotest parts; that everywhere is plan, development, evolution&mdash;to
know these and kindred things&mdash;a few of the fundamentals of
science&mdash;is a joy to the spirit and a light to the mind.</p>

<p>Science in the world is like the surveyor and the engineer in a new
country; it opens up highways for the mind; it bridges the chasms and
marshes; it gives us dominion over the wild; it brings order out of
chaos. What a maze, what a tangle the world is till we come to look
upon it with the clews and solutions in mind which science affords!
The heavens seem a haphazard spatter of stars, the earth a wild jumble
of plants, and animals, and blind forces all struggling with one
another&mdash;confusion, contradiction, failure everywhere. And so it was
to the early men, and so it still is to those who have not the light
of science, but so it need not remain to the child born into the world
to-day. The great mysteries of life and death, of final causes and
ultimate ends, still remain and will continue, but nature now,
compared with the nature of a few centuries ago, is like a land
subdued and peopled and cultivated compared with a pathless wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
And yet I would not in this connection, when considering
the field of natural history, lay too much stress upon the scientific
aspects of the question. To the real nature-lover the bird in the bush
is worth much more than the bird in the hand, because the nature-lover
is not after a specimen: he is after a living fact; he is after a new
joy in life.</p>

<p>It is an important part, but by no means the main part of what
ornithology holds for us, to be able to name every bird on sight or
call. To love the bird, to appreciate its place in the landscape and
in the season, to relate it to your daily life, to divine its
character, to know it emotionally in your heart&mdash;that is much more. To
know the birds as the sportsman knows his game; to experience the same
thrill, purged of all thoughts of slaughter; to make their songs music
in your life&mdash;this is indeed something to be desired.</p>

<p>The same with botany. I regard its class-room uses as very slight. The
educational value of the technical part is almost <i>nil</i>. But the
humanizing value of a love of the flowers, the hygienic value of a
walk in their haunts, the &#230;sthetic value of the observation of their
forms and tints&mdash;these are all vital. The scientific value which
attaches to your knowledge of the names of their parts or of their
families&mdash;what is that? Their habits are interesting; their means of
fertilization are interesting; the part insects play in their
lives&mdash;the honey-yielders, the pollen-yielders, their means of
scattering their seeds, and so forth&mdash;all are interesting. To know
their habitats and seasons; to have associations with them when you go
fishing; to land your trout in a bed of bee-palm or jewel-weed; to
pluck the linn&#230;a in the moss on the Adirondack mountain you are
climbing; to gather pond-lilies from a boat with your friend; to pluck
the arbutus on the first balmy day of April; to see the scarlet
lobelia lighting up a dark nook by the stream as you row by in August;
to walk or drive past vast acres of purple loosestrife, looking like a
lake or sea of color&mdash;this is botany with something back of it, and
the only place to learn it is where it grows. The botany that trails
the days and the season and the woods and the fields with it&mdash;that is
the kind that has educational value in it.</p>

<p>I confess I have not much sympathy with the laboratory study of
nature, except for economic purposes. Nature under the dissecting
knife and the microscope yields important secrets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
to the students of biology, but the unprofessional students want but
little of all this. I know a young woman who took a post-graduate
course in biology at a noted summer school, and the one thing she
learned was that certain bacilli were found only in the aqueous humor
of the eyes of white mice. The world is full of curious facts like
that, that have no human interest or educational value whatever.</p>

<p>If one could number all the trees of the forest and all the leaves
upon the trees, what would it profit him? To know the different kinds
of trees when you see them, and the function of the leaves upon
them&mdash;that were more worth while. I have read studies of leaves that
were just as profitless as to know their numbers. I have heard
discourses upon the changes in the plumage of certain water-fowl from
youth to age, and from one moult to another, that were as profitless
and wearisome as studying the variations of the leaves or their
numbers.</p>

<p>I hardly know why I am impatient when people come to me with their
hands full of different leaves and ask me what tree is this from, and
this, and this? If your business is not with trees, if you live in the
city and care mainly for city things, why bother about the trees,
unless for the pleasure of it during your summer excursions into the
country; and if it affords you pleasure, you will not want any one to
tell you: you will want to identify the trees themselves.</p>

<p>The same with the birds. The main profit of this branch of natural
history is in the pursuit&mdash;not in the name, but in the bird. It is the
chase that allures the sportsman, and it is the chase that profits the
nature-student. Did you ever receive a gift of brook-trout by express?
How pitiful they look&mdash;stale fish only! But the trout you brought in
at night after threading for miles the mountain stream: its voice all
day in your ears; its sparkle all day in your eyes; the love of its
beauty and purity all day in your heart; wading through bee-balm or
jewel-weed; skirting wild pastures; starting the grouse or the
woodcock with their young; surprising bird and beast at their home
occupations&mdash;these were trout with a flavor.</p>

<p>Whatever opens up new doors or windows for us into the world about us,
whatever widens the field of our interests and sympathies, has some
sort of value&mdash;moral, intellectual, or &#230;sthetic. But much of the
so-called nature-study opens no new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
doors or windows; it affords no mental satisfaction, or illumination,
or &#230;sthetic pleasure; it is mainly pottering with dry,
unimportant facts and details. Do you know the edelweiss of our own
matchless arbutus after you have merely analyzed and classified them?
No more than you know a man after having weighed and measured him. The
function of things is always interesting. What do they do? How do they
pay their way in the rigid economy of nature? How do they survive? How
does the bulb of the common fawn-lily<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> get deeper and deeper into
the ground each year? Why does the wild ginger hide its blossom when
nearly all other plants flaunt theirs? Why are the plants of the
common mouse-ear (<i>antennaria</i>)<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a> <a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> always in groups, one sex here,
another there, as if prohibited from mingling by some moral code in
nature? Why do nearly all our trees have a twist to the right or the
left&mdash;hard woods one way, and soft woods the other? Why do the
roots of trees flow through the ground like "runnels of molten metal,"
often separating and uniting again while the branches are thrust out
in right lines or curves? Why is our common yellow birch more often
than any other tree planted upon a rock? Why do oaks or chestnuts so
often spring up where a pine or hemlock forest has been cleared away?
Why does lightning so commonly strike a hemlock tree or a pine or an
oak, and rarely or never a beech? Why does the bolt sometimes scatter
the tree about, and at others only plow a channel down its trunk? Why
does the bumblebee complain so loudly when working upon certain
flowers? Why does the honey-bee lose the sting when it stings a
person, while the wasp, the hornet, and the bumblebee do not? How does
the chimney-swallow get the twigs it builds its nest with? From what
does the hornet make its paper?</p>

<p>One of Herbert Spencer's questions was, Why do animals and birds of
prey have their eyes in front, and others, as sheep and domestic fowl,
on the side of the head? Man, then, by the position of his eyes
belongs to the predaceous animals. I have never been greatly
interested in spiders, but I have always wanted to know how a certain
spider managed to stretch her cable squarely across the road in the
woods about my height from the ground? Why are mud turtles so wild?
Why is the excrement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
of the young of some birds carried away by the parents, while with
others it is voided from the nest? Among certain of our birds the
family relation, more or less marked, is kept up a long time after the
young have left the nest. One sees the parent birds and the young
going about in loose flocks often till late into the fall. Of what
birds is this true?</p>

<p>The questions I have suggested are not important; they do not hold the
key to any great storehouse of natural knowledge. Their only value is
as a means to quicken the powers of observation. We see vaguely,
diffusely. Concentrate the attention&mdash;not to the extent of missing
total effects, as the specialist so often does, but for the purpose of
reading correctly the play of life that is constantly going about us.</p>

<p>Nature's book is like any other book: you must open the covers; you
must fix your eyes upon the text; you must get into the spirit of it.
When you have read one sentence correctly you are so much the better
prepared to read the next one.</p>

<p>A world of nature about us that we are quite apt to be oblivious to,
except as it results in our annoyance, is the insect world. We do not
take an intelligent interest in the ants, or the bees, or the moths,
or the butterflies, yet here is a field of observation that will amply
repay one. One day in a great city I saw a butterfly calmly winging
its way high above the crowded street. I knew it was the monarch
(<i>Anosia plexippus</i>), probably the greatest traveler of all our
butterflies. It is quite certain that they migrate to the South in the
fall, and that many return in the spring. I learn from Mr. Holland's
Butterfly Book in this library that they have even crossed both
oceans&mdash;of course, by catching a ride on vessels&mdash;and are now found in
Australia and in the Philippines, and they have been collected in
England. Have you not seen its chrysalis suspended from some weed or
bush, looking like the trunk from some tiny warrior encased in
pale-green armor, riveted with gold-headed rivets, a broad, heavy
shield over the abdomen, and plate upon plate over the shoulders and
back? It is a milkweed butterfly, and will serve as a good
introduction to this new world of winged life. Early last spring I
found upon the window of my cabin in the woods a butterfly that had
evidently hybernated in some snug crack or corner of the building.
This was the mourning cloak, with me the first vernal butterfly. When
one sees this butterfly dancing through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
the open sunny woods in March or early April he may know spring has
really come and that the first hepatica will soon open its blue eye.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard's Insect Book ought to start many of its readers to
observing flies and bees and prying into their life-histories, many of
which are as yet not fully known. Not a farm-boy but knows of the big
fat grubs in cows' backs in the spring. It was always a mystery to me
how they got there. Now it is known that the creature has traveled all
the way from the cow's stomach, where the egg of its parent&mdash;the
bot-fly&mdash;was hatched, making its way slowly "through the connective
tissues of the cow, between the skin and the flesh, penetrating
gradually along the neck, and ultimately reaching a point beneath the
skin on the back of the animal."</p>

<p>We have only to look into nature a little more closely and intently,
to whet our powers of observation by the use of such books as this
Nature Library contains, to add vastly to our pleasure in and our
knowledge of the world that lies about us.</p>

<div class="caption2">INTRODUCTION</div>

<p>I write these few introductory sentences to this volume only to second
so worthy an attempt to quicken and enlarge the general interest in
our birds. The book itself is merely an introduction, and is only
designed to place a few clews in the reader's hands which he himself
or herself is to follow up. I can say that it is reliable and is
written in a vivacious strain and by a real bird lover, and should
prove a help and a stimulus to any one who seeks by the aid of its
pages to become better acquainted with our songsters. The pictures,
with a few exceptions, are remarkably good and accurate, and these,
with the various grouping of the birds according to color, season,
habitat, etc., ought to render the identification of the birds, with
no other weapon than an opera glass, an easy matter.</p>

<p>When I began the study of the birds I had access to a copy of Audubon,
which greatly stimulated my interest in the pursuit, but I did not
have the opera glass, and I could not take Audubon with me on my
walks, as the reader may this volume, and he will find these colored
plates quite as helpful as those of Audubon or Wilson.</p>

<p>But you do not want to make out your bird the first time; the book or
your friend must not make the problem too easy for you. You must go
again and again, and see and hear your bird under varying conditions
and get a good hold of several of its characteristic traits. Things
easily learned are apt to be easily forgotten. Some ladies, beginning
the study of birds, once wrote to me, asking if I would not please
come and help them, and set them right about certain birds in dispute.
I replied that that would be getting their knowledge too easily; that
what I and any one else told them they would be very apt to forget,
but that the things they found out themselves they would always
remember. We must in a way earn what we have or keep. Only thus does
it become <i>ours</i>, a real part of us.</p>

<p>Not very long afterward I had the pleasure of walking with one of the
ladies, and I found her eye and ear quite as sharp as my own, and that
she was in a fair way to conquer the bird kingdom without any outside
help. She said that the groves and fields, through which she used to
walk with only a languid interest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
were now completely transformed to her and afforded her the keenest
pleasure; a whole new world of interest had been disclosed to her; she
felt as if she was constantly on the eve of some new discovery; the
next turn in the path might reveal to her a new warbler or a new
vireo. I remember the thrill she seemed to experience when I called
her attention to a purple finch singing in the tree-tops in front of
her house, a rare visitant she had not before heard. The thrill would
of course have been greater had she identified the bird without my
aid. One would rather bag one's own game, whether it be with a bullet
or an eyebeam.</p>

<p>The experience of this lady is the experience of all in whom is
kindled this bird enthusiasm. A new interest is added to life; one
more resource against ennui and stagnation. If you have only a city
yard with a few sickly trees in it, you will find great delight in
noting the numerous stragglers from the great army of spring and
autumn migrants that find their way there. If you live in the country,
it is as if new eyes and new ears were given you, with a
correspondingly increased capacity for rural enjoyment.</p>

<p>The birds link themselves to your memory of seasons and places, so
that a song, a call, a gleam of color, set going a sequence of
delightful reminiscences in your mind. When a solitary great Carolina
wren came one August day and took up its abode near me and sang and
called and warbled as I had heard it long before on the Potomac, how
it brought the old days, the old scenes back again, and made me for
the moment younger by all those years!</p>

<p>A few seasons ago I feared the tribe of bluebirds were on the verge of
extinction from the enormous number of them that perished from cold
and hunger in the South in the winter of '94. For two summers not a
blue wing, not a blue warble. I seemed to miss something kindred and
precious from my environment&mdash;the visible embodiment of the tender sky
and the wistful soil. What a loss, I said, to the coming generations
of dwellers in the country&mdash;no bluebird in the spring! What will the
farm-boy date from? But the fear was groundless: the birds are
regaining their lost ground; broods of young blue-coats are again seen
drifting from stake to stake or from mullen-stalk to mullen-stalk
about the fields in summer, and our April air will doubtless again be
warmed and thrilled by this lovely harbinger of spring.</p>

underneath white, and belted with blue or rusty. Bill large and heavy.
Middle and outer toes joined for half their length. Call-note loud and

and always with some red feathers about the head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg_4]</a></span>
(The flicker is brownish and yellow instead of black and white.)
Stocky, high-shouldered build; bill strong and long for drilling holes
in bark of trees. Tail feathers pointed and stiffened to serve as a
prop. Two toes before and two behind for clinging. Usually seen
clinging erect on tree-trunks; rarely, if ever, head downward, like
the nuthatches, titmice, etc. Woodpeckers feed as they creep around
the trunks and branches. Habits rather phlegmatic. The flicker has
better developed vocal powers than other birds of this class, whose
rolling tattoo, beaten with their bills against the tree-trunks, must
answer for their love-song. Nest in hollowed-out trees.</p>

<p>Medium-sized, mottled brownish, gray, black, and white birds of heavy
build. Short, thick head; gaping, large mouth; very small bill, with
bristles at base. Take insect food on the wing. Feet small and weak;
wings long and powerful. These birds rest lengthwise on their perch

with sharp spines, used as props. They show their kinship with the
goatsuckers in their nocturnal as well as diurnal habits, their small
bills and large mouths for catching insects or

that are sometimes crested. Bills hooked at end, and with bristles at
base. Harsh or plaintive voices. Wings longer than tail; both wings
and tails usually drooped and vibrating when the birds are perching.
Habits moody and silent when perching on a conspicuous limb, telegraph
wire, dead tree, or fence rail and waiting for insects to fly within
range. Sudden, nervous, spasmodic sallies in midair to seize insects
on the wing. Usually they return to their identical perch or lookout.

<p>The only true larks to be found in this country are the two species
given below. They are the kin of the European skylark, of which
several unsuccessful attempts to introduce the bird have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg_6]</a></span>
been made in this country. These two larks must not be confused with
the meadow larks and titlarks, which belong to the blackbird and pipit
families respectively. The horned larks are birds of the ground, and
are seen in the United States only in the autumn and winter. In the
nesting season at the North their voices are most musical. Plumage
grayish and brown, in color harmony with their habitats. Usually found
in flocks; the first species on or near the shore.</p>

rather than strictly migratory, for, except at the northern limit of
range, they remain resident all the year. Gregarious. Sexes alike.
Omnivorous feeders, being partly carnivorous, as are also the jays.
Both crows and jays inhabit wooded country. Their voices are harsh and
clamorous; and their habits are boisterous and bold, particularly the

feet for use upon the ground, where they generally feed, while the
orioles are birds of the trees. They are both seed and insect eaters.
The bills of the bobolink and cowbird are short and conical, for they
are conspicuous seed eaters. Bills of the others long and conical,
adapted for insectivorous diet. About half the family are gifted

<p>Generally fine songsters. Bills conical, short, and stout for cracking
seeds. Length from five to nine inches, usually under eight inches.
This, the largest family of birds that we have (about one-seventh of
all our birds belong to it), comprises birds of such varied plumage
and habit that, while certain family resemblances may be traced
throughout, it is almost impossible to characterize the family as
such. The <i>sparrows</i> are comparatively small gray and brown birds with
striped upper parts, lighter underneath. Birds of the ground, or not
far from it, elevated perches being chosen for rest and song. Nest in
low bushes or on the ground. (Chipping sparrow often selects tall
trees.) Coloring adapted to grassy, dusty habitats. Males and females
similar. Flight labored. About forty species of sparrows are found in
the United States; of these, fourteen may be met with by a novice, and
six, at least, surely will be.</p>

<p>The <i>finches</i> and their larger kin are chiefly bright-plumaged birds,
the females either duller or distinct from males; bills heavy, dull,
and conical, befitting seed eaters. Not so migratory as insectivorous
birds nor so restless. Mostly phlegmatic in temperament. Fine
songsters.</p>

<div class="caption2"><i>Family Tanagrid&#230;</i>: TANAGERS</div>

<p>Distinctly an American family, remarkable for their brilliant plumage,
which, however, undergoes great changes twice a year, Females
different from males, being dull and inconspicuous. Birds of the
tropics, two species only finding their way north, and the summer
tanager rarely found north of Pennsylvania. Shy inhabitants of woods.
Though they may nest low in trees, they choose high perches when
singing or feeding upon flowers, fruits, and insects. As a family, the
tanagers have weak, squeaky voices, but both our species are good
songsters. Suffering the fate of most bright-plumaged birds, immense
numbers have been shot annually.</p>

<div class="caption2"><i>Family Mniotiltid&#230;</i>: WOOD WARBLERS</div>

<p>A large group of birds, for the most part smaller than the English
sparrow; all, except the ground warblers, of beautiful plumage, in
which yellow, olive, slate-blue, black, and white are predominant
colors. Females generally duller than males. Exceedingly active,
graceful, restless feeders among the terminal twigs of trees and
shrubbery; haunters of tree-tops in the woods at nesting time.
Abundant birds, especially during May and September, when the majority
are migrating to and from regions north of the United States; but they
are strangely unknown to all but devoted bird lovers, who seek them
out during these months that particularly favor acquaintance. Several
species are erratic in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg_11]</a></span>
their migrations and choose a different course
to return southward from the one they travelled over in spring. A few
species are summer residents, and one, at least, of this tropical
family, the myrtle warbler, winters at the north. The habits of the
family are not identical in every representative; some are more
deliberate and less nervous than others; a few, like the Canadian and
Wilson's warblers, are expert flycatchers, taking their food on the
wing, but not usually returning to the same perch, like true
flycatchers; and a few of the warblers, as, for example, the
black-and-white, the pine, and the worm-eating species, have the
nuthatches' habit of creeping around the bark of trees. Quite a number
feed upon the ground. All are insectivorous, though many vary their
diet with blossom, fruit, or berries, and naturally their bills are
slender and sharply pointed, rarely finch-like. The yellow-breasted
chat has the greatest variety of vocal expressions. The ground
warblers are compensated for their sober, thrush-like plumage by their
exquisite voices, while the great majority of the family that are
gaily dressed have notes that either resemble the trill of midsummer
insects or, by their limited range and feeble utterance, sadly belie
the family name.</p>

<p>Only three birds of this family inhabit North America, and of these
only one is common enough, east of the Mississippi, to be included in
this book. Terrestrial birds of open tracts near the coast,
stubble-fields, and country roadsides, with brownish plumage to
harmonize with their surroundings. The American pipit, or titlark, has
a peculiar wavering flight when, after being flushed, it reluctantly
leaves the ground. Then its white tail feathers are conspicuous. Its
habit of wagging its tail when perching is not an exclusive family
trait, as the family name might imply.</p>

<p>Apparently the birds that comprise this large general family are too
unlike to be related, but the missing links or intermediate species
may all be found far South. The first subfamily is comprised of
distinctively American birds. Most numerous in the tropics. Their long
tails serve a double purpose&mdash;in assisting their flight and acting as
an outlet for their vivacity. Usually they inhabit scrubby undergrowth
bordering woods. They rank among our finest songsters, with
ventriloquial and imitative powers added to sweetness of tone.</p>

chiefly in winter walking up and down the barks of trees, and
sometimes running along the under side of branches upside down, like
flies. Plumage compact and smooth. Their name is derived from their
habit of wedging nuts (usually beech-nuts) in the bark of trees, and
then hatching them open with their strong straight bills.</p>

expert climbers, though not such wonderful gymnasts as the nuthatches.
These cousins are frequently seen together in winter woods or in the

<p>If we have an eye for the picturesque, we place a certain value upon
the broad, strong dash of color in the landscape, given by a flock of
crows flapping their course above a corn-field, against an October
sky; but the practical eye of the farmer looks only for his gun in
such a case. To him the crow is an unmitigated nuisance, all the more
maddening because it is clever enough to circumvent every means
devised for its ruin. Nothing escapes its rapacity; fear is unknown to
it. It migrates in broad daylight, chooses the most conspicuous
perches, and yet its assurance is amply justified in its steadily
increasing numbers.</p>

<p>In the very early spring, note well the friendly way in which the crow
follows the plow, ingratiating itself by eating the larv&#230;, field mice,
and worms upturned in the furrows, for this is its one serviceable act
throughout the year. When the first brood of chickens is hatched, its
serious depredations begin. Not only the farmer's young fledglings,
ducks, turkeys, and chicks, are snatched up and devoured, but the
nests of song birds are made desolate, eggs being crushed and eaten on
the spot, when there are no birds to carry off to the rickety, coarse
nest in the high tree top in the woods. The fish crow, however, is the much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg_42]</a></span>
greater enemy of the birds. Like the common crows, this, their
smaller cousin, likes to congregate in winter along the seacoast to
feed upon shell-fish and other sea-food that the tide brings to its
feet.</p>

<p>Samuels claims to have seen a pair of crows visit an orchard and
destroy the young in two robins' nests in half an hour. He calculates
that two crows kill, in one day alone, young birds that in the course
of the season would have eaten a hundred thousand insects. When, in
addition to these atrocities, we remember the crow's depredations in
the corn-field, it is small wonder that among the first laws enacted
in New York State was one offering a reward for its head. But the more
scientific agriculturists now concede that the crow is the farmer's
true friend.</p>

<p>Compared with the common crow, with which it is often confounded, the
fish crow is of much smaller, more slender build. Thus its flight is
less labored and more like a gull's, whose habit of catching fish that
may be swimming near the surface of the water it sometimes adopts.
Both Audubon and Wilson, who first made this species known, record its
habit of snatching food as it flies over the southern waters&mdash;a rare
practice at the north. Its plumage, too, differs slightly from the
common crow's in being a richer black everywhere, and particularly
underneath, where the "corn thief" is dull. But it is the difference
between the two crows' call-note that we chiefly depend upon to
distinguish these confusing cousins. To say that the fish crow says
<i>car-r-r</i> instead of a loud, clear <i>caw</i>, means little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg_43]</a></span>
until we have had an opportunity to compare its hoarse, cracked voice
with the other bird's familiar call.</p>

<p>From the farmer's point of view, there is still another distinction:
the fish crow lets his crops alone. It contents itself with picking up
refuse on the shores of the sea or rivers not far inland; haunting the
neighborhood of fishermen's huts for the small fish discarded when the
seines are drawn, and treading out with its toes the shell-fish hidden
in the sand at low tide. When we see it in the fields it is usually
intent upon catching field-mice, grubs, and worms, with which it often
varies its fish diet. It is, however, the worst nest robber we have;
it probably destroys ten times as many eggs and young birds as its
larger cousin.</p>

<p>The fishermen have a tradition that this southern crow comes and goes
with the shad and herring&mdash;a saw which science unkindly disapproves.</p>

<p>The weird, uncanny voice of this great bird that soars in wide circles
above the evergreen trees of dark northern forests seems to come out
of the skies like the malediction of an evil spirit. Without uttering
the words of any language&mdash;Poe's "Nevermore" was, of course, a poetic
license&mdash;people of all nationalities appear to understand that some
dire calamity, some wicked portent, is being announced every time the
unbirdlike creature utters its rasping call. The superstitious folk
crow with an "I told you so," as they solemnly wag their heads when
they hear of some death in the village after "the bird of ill-omen" has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg_44]</a></span>
made an unwelcome visit to the neighborhood. It receives the
blame for every possible misfortune.</p>

<p>When seen in the air, the crow is the only other bird for which the
raven could be mistaken; but the raven does more sailing and less
flapping, and he delights in describing circles as he easily soars
high above the trees. On the ground, he is seen to be a far larger
bird than the largest crow. The curious beard or fringe of feathers on
his breast at once distinguishes him.</p>

<p>These birds show the family instinct for living in flocks large and
small, not of ravens only, but of any birds of their own genera. In
the art of nest building they could instruct most of their relatives.
High up in evergreen trees or on the top of cliffs, never very near
the seashore, they make a compact, symmetrical nest of sticks, neatly
lined with grasses and wool from the sheep pastures, adding soft,
comfortable linings to the old nest from year to year for each new
brood. When the young emerge from the eggs, which take many curious
freaks of color and markings, they are pied black and white,
suggesting the young of the western white-necked raven, a similarity
which, so far as plumage is concerned, they quickly outgrow. They
early acquire the fortunate habit of eating whatever their parents set
before them&mdash;grubs, worms, grain, field-mice; anything, in fact, for
the raven is a conspicuously omnivorous bird.</p>

This "refined crow" (which is really no crow at all except in
appearance) has scarcely more friends than a thief is entitled to;
for, although in many sections of the country it has given up its old
habit of stealing Indian corn and substituted ravages upon the
grasshoppers instead, it still indulges a crow-like instinct for
pillaging nests and eating young birds.</p>

<p>Travelling in immense flocks of its own kind, a gregarious bird of the
first order, it nevertheless is not the social fellow that its cousin,
the red-winged blackbird, is. It especially holds aloof from mankind,
and mankind reciprocates its suspicion.</p>

<p>The tallest, densest evergreens are not too remote for it to build its
home, according to Dr. Abbott, though in other States than New Jersey,
where he observed them, an old orchard often contains dozens of nests.
One peculiarity of the grackles is that their eggs vary so much in
coloring and markings that different sets examined in the same groups
of trees are often wholly unlike. The average groundwork, however, is
soiled blue or greenish, waved, streaked, or clouded with brown. These
are laid in a nest made of miscellaneous sticks and grasses, rather
carefully constructed, and lined with mud. Another peculiarity is the
bird's method of steering itself by its tail when it wishes to turn
its direction or alight.</p>

<p>Peering at you from the top of a dark pine tree with its staring
yellow eye, the grackle is certainly uncanny. There, very early in the
spring, you may hear its cracked and wheezy whistle, for, being aware
that however much it may look like a crow it belongs to another
family, it makes a ridiculous attempt to sing. When a number of
grackles lift up their voices at once, some one has aptly likened the
result to a "good wheel-barrow chorus!" The grackle's mate alone
appreciates his efforts as, standing on tiptoe, with half-spread wings
and tail, he pours forth his craven soul to her through a disjointed
larynx.</p>

<p>With all their faults, and they are numerous, let it be recorded of
both crows and grackles that they are as devoted lovers as
turtle-doves. Lowell characterizes them in these four lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

The Bronzed Grackle (<i>Quiscalus quiscula &#230;neus</i>) differs from the
preceding chiefly in the more brownish bronze tint of its plumage and
its lack of iridescent bars. Its range is more westerly, and in the
southwest it is particularly common; but as a summer resident it finds
its way to New England in large numbers. The call-note is louder and
more metallic than the purple grackle's. In nearly all respects the
habits of these two birds are identical.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;April. November. A few winter north.</div>

<p>A more sociable bird than the grackle, though it travel in smaller
flocks, the rusty blackbird condescends to mingle freely with other
feathered friends in marshes and by brooksides. You can identify it by
its rusty feathers and pale yellow eye, and easily distinguish the
rusty-gray female from the female red-wing that is conspicuously
streaked.</p>

<p>In April flocks of these birds may frequently be seen along sluggish,
secluded streams in the woods, feeding upon the seeds of various water
or brookside plants, and probably upon insects also. At such times
they often indulge in a curious spluttering, squeaking, musical
concert that one listens to with pleasure. The breeding range is
mostly north of the United States. But little seems to be known of the
birds' habits in their northern home.</p>

<p>Why it should ever have been called a thrush blackbird is one of those
inscrutable mysteries peculiar to the naming of birds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg_47]</a></span>
which are so frequently called precisely what they are not. In spite
of the compliment implied in associating the name of one of our finest
songsters with it, the rusty blackbird has a clucking call as
unmusical as it is infrequent, and only very rarely in the spring does
it pipe a note that even suggests the sweetness of the redwing's.</p>

<p>In oozy pastures where a brook lazily finds its way through the farm
is the ideal pleasure ground of this "bird of society." His notes,
"<i>h'-wa-ker-ee</i>" or "<i>con-quer-ee</i>" (on an ascending scale), are
liquid in quality, suggesting the sweet, moist, cool retreats where he
nests. Liking either heat or cold (he is fond of wintering in Florida,
but often retreats to the north while the marshes are still frozen);
enjoying not only the company of large flocks of his own kind with
whom he travels, but any bird associates with whom he can scrape
acquaintance; or to sit quietly on a tree-top in the secluded,
inaccessible bog while his mate is nesting; satisfied with cut-worms,
grubs, and insects, or with fruit and grain for his food&mdash;the
blackbird is an impressive and helpful example of how to get the best
out of life.</p>

<p>Yet, of all the birds, some farmers complain that the blackbird is the
greatest nuisance. They dislike the noisy chatterings when a flock is
simply indulging its social instincts. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg_48]</a></span>
complain, too, that the blackbirds eat their corn, forgetting that
having devoured innumerable grubs from it during the summer, the birds
feel justly entitled to a share of the profits. Though occasionally
guilty of eating the farmer's corn and oats and rice, yet it has been
found that nearly seven-eighths of the redwing's food is made up of
weed-seeds or of insects injurious to agriculture.</p>

<p>This bird builds its nest in low bushes on the margin of ponds or low
in the bog grass of marshes. From three to five pale-blue eggs,
curiously streaked, spotted, and scrawled with black or purple,
constitute a brood. Nursery duties are soon finished, for in July the
young birds are ready to gather in flocks with their elders.</p>

<p>In old-fashioned gardens, set on a pole over which honeysuckle and
roses climbed from a bed where China pinks, phlox, sweet Williams, and
hollyhocks crowded each other below, martin boxes used always to be
seen with a pair of these large, beautiful swallows circling overhead.
But now, alas! the boxes, where set up at all, are quickly monopolized
by the English sparrow, a bird that the martin, courageous as a
kingbird in attacking crows and hawks, tolerates as a neighbor only
when it must.</p>

<p>Bradford Torrey tells of seeing quantities of long-necked squashes
dangling from poles about the negro cabins all through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg_49]</a></span>
the South. One day he asked an old colored man what these squashes
were for.</p>

<p>"Why, deh is martins' boxes," said Uncle Remus. "No danger of hawks
carryin' off de chickens so long as de martins am around."</p>

<p>The Indians, too, have always had a special liking for this bird. They
often lined a hollowed-out gourd with bits of bark and fastened it in
the crotch of their tent poles to invite its friendship. The Mohegan
Indians have called it "the bird that never rests"&mdash;a name better
suited to the tireless barn swallow, Dr. Abbott thinks.</p>

<p>Wasps, beetles, and all manner of injurious garden insects constitute
its diet&mdash;another reason for its universal popularity. It is simple
enough to distinguish the martins from the other swallows by their
larger size and iridescent dark coat, not to mention their song, which
is very soft and sweet, like musical laughter, rippling up through the
throat.</p>

<p>The cowbird takes its name from its habit of walking about among the
cattle in the pasture, picking up the small insects which the cattle
disturb in their grazing. The bird may often be seen within a foot or
two of the nose of a cow or heifer, walking briskly about like a
miniature hen, intently watching for its insect prey.</p>

<p>Its marital and domestic character is thoroughly bad.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg_50]</a></span>
Polygamous and utterly irresponsible for its offspring, this bird
forms a striking contrast to other feathered neighbors, and indeed is
almost an anomaly in the animal kingdom. In the breeding season an
unnatural mother may be seen skulking about in the trees and
shrubbery, seeking for nests in which to place a surreptitious egg,
never imposing it upon a bird of its size, but selecting in a cowardly
way a small nest, as that of the vireos or warblers or chipping
sparrows, and there leaving the hatching and care of its young to the
tender mercies of some already burdened little mother. It has been
seen to remove an egg from the nest of the red-eyed vireo in order to
place one of its own in its place. Not finding a convenient nest, it
will even drop its eggs on the ground, trusting them to merciless
fate, or, still worse, devouring them. The eggs are nearly an inch
long, white speckled with brown or gray. (Illustration facing p. <a href="#IMG_COWBIRD">54</a>.)</p>

<p>Cowbirds are gregarious. The ungrateful young birds, as soon as they
are able to go roaming, leave their foster-parents and join the flock
of their own kind. In keeping with its unclean habits and unholy life
and character, the cowbird's ordinary note is a gurgling, rasping
whistle, followed by a few sharp notes.</p>

<div class="caption2">The Starling<br />

(<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>)</div>


<div class="blockquot"><i>Length</i>&mdash;8 to 9 inches. Weight about equals that of robin,
but the starling, with its short, drooping tail, is chunkier
in appearance.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Male</i>&mdash;Iridescent black with glints of purple, green, and
blue. On back the black feathers, with iridescence of green,
and bronze, are tipped with brown, as are some of the tail and
wing feathers. In autumn and early winter feathers of sides of
head, breast, flanks and underparts are tipped with white,
giving a gray, mottled appearance. During the winter most of
the white tips on breast and underparts wear off. Until the
first moult in late summer the young birds are a dark
olive-brown in color, with white or whitish throat. These
differences in plumage at different seasons and different ages
make starlings hard to identify. Red-winged blackbirds and
grackles are often mistaken for them. From early spring till
mid-June, starling's rather long, sharp bill is yellow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50a" id="Page_50a">[Pg_50a]</a></span>
Later in summer it darkens. No other black bird of ours has this
yellow bill at any season.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Female</i>&mdash;Similar in appearance.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Range</i>&mdash;Massachusetts to Maryland. Not common beyond 100
miles inland. (Native of northern Europe and Asia.)</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;Permanent resident, but flocks show some
tendency to drift southward in winter.</div>

<p>This newcomer to our shores is by no means so black as he has been
painted. Like many other European immigrants he landed at or near
Castle Garden, New York City, and his descendants have not cared to
wander very far from this vicinity, preferring regions with a pretty
numerous human population. The starlings have increased so fast in
this limited region since their first permanent settlement in Central
Park about 1890 that farmers and suburban dwellers have feared that
they might become as undesirable citizens as some other Europeans&mdash;the
brown rat, the house mouse, and the English sparrow. But a very
thorough investigation conducted by the United States Bureau of
Biological Survey (Bulletin No. 868, 1921) is most reassuring in its
results.</p>

<p>Let us first state the case for the prosecution: (1) the starling must
plead guilty to a fondness for cultivated cherries; (2) he is often a
persecutor of native birds, like the bluebird and flicker; (3) his
roosts, where he sometimes congregates in thousands in the autumn, are
apt to become public nuisances, offensive alike to the eye, the nose
and the ear.</p>

<p>But these offences are not so very serious after all. He does not eat
so many cherries as our old friend the robin, though his depredations
are more conspicuous, for whereas the robins in ones and twos will
pilfer steadily from many trees for many days without attracting
notice, a crowd of starlings is occasionally observed to descend <i>en
masse</i> upon a single tree and strip it in a few hours. Naturally such
high-handed procedure is observed by many and deeply resented by the
owner of the tree, who suffers the steady but less spectacular raids
of the robins without serious disquiet.</p>

<p>Less can be said in defense of the starling's scandalous treatment of
some native birds. "Unrelenting perseverance dominates the starling's
activities when engaged in a controversy over a nesting site. More of
its battles are won by dogged persistence in annoying its victim than
by bold aggression, and its irritating tactics are sometimes carried
to such a point that it seems almost as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50b" id="Page_50b">[Pg_50b]</a></span>
the bird were actuated more by a morbid pleasure of annoying its
neighbors than by any necessity arising from a scarcity of nesting
sites&#8230;.</p>

<p>"In contests with the flicker the starling frequently makes up in
numbers what disadvantage it may have in size. Typical of such combats
was the one observed on May 9, at Hartford, Conn., where a group of
starlings and a flicker were in controversy over a newly excavated
nest. The number of starlings varied, but as many as 6 were noted at
one time. Attention was first attracted to the dispute by a number of
starlings in close proximity to the hole and by the sounds of a tussle
within. Presently a flicker came out dragging a starling after him.
The starling continued the battle outside long enough to allow one of
its comrades to slip into the nest. Of course the flicker had to
repeat the entire performance. He did this for about half an hour,
when he gave up, leaving the starlings in possession of the nest&#8230;.</p>

<p>"Economically considered, the starling is the superior of either the
flicker, the robin, or the English sparrow, three of the species with
which it comes in contact in its breeding operations. The eggs and
young of bluebirds and wrens may be protected by the use of nest boxes
with circular openings 1&#189; inches or less in diameter. This leaves
the purple martin the only species readily subject to attack by the
starling, whose economic worth may be considered greater than that of
the latter, but in no case was the disturbance of a well-established
colony of martins noted."</p>

<p>As for the nuisance of a big established roost of starlings, it may be
abated by nightly salvos of Roman candles or blank cartridges,
continued for a week or at most ten days.</p>

<p>So much for the starling in his aspect as an undesirable citizen.
Government investigators, by a long-continued study, have discovered
that his good deeds far outnumber his misdemeanors. Primarily he feeds
on noxious insects and useless wild fruits. Small truck gardens and
individual cherry trees may be occasionally raided by large flocks
with disastrous results in a small way. But on the whole he is a
useful frequenter of our door-yards who pays his way by destroying
hosts of cut-worms and equally noxious insects. "A thorough
consideration of the evidence at hand indicates that, based on food
habits, the adult starling is the economic superior of the robin,
catbird, flicker, red-winged blackbird, or grackle." Need more be said
for him?</p>

<div class="caption2">Red-headed Woodpecker<br />

(<i>Melanerpes erythrocephalus</i>) Woodpecker family</div>

<div class="caption3"><i>Called also</i>: TRI-COLOR, RED-HEAD</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Length</i>&mdash;8.50 to 9.75 inches. An inch or less smaller than
the robin.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Male and Female</i>&mdash;Head, neck, and throat crimson; breast and
underneath white; back black and white; wings and tail blue
black, with broad white band on wings conspicuous in flight.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Range</i>&mdash;United States, east of Rocky Mountains and north to
Manitoba.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;Abundant but irregular migrant. Most commonly
seen in Autumn, and rarely resident.</div>

<p>In thinly populated sections, where there are few guns about, this is
still one of the commonest as it is perhaps the most conspicuous
member of the woodpecker family, but its striking glossy
black-and-white body and its still more striking crimson head,
flattened out against the side of a tree like a target, where it is
feeding, have made it all too tempting a mark for the rifles of the
sportsmen and the sling-shots of small boys. As if sufficient
attention were not attracted to it by its plumage, it must needs keep
up a noisy, guttural rattle, <i>ker-r-ruck, ker-r-ruck,</i> very like a
tree-toad's call, and flit about among the trees with the restlessness
of a flycatcher. Yet, in spite of these invitations for a shot to the
passing gunner, it still multiplies in districts where nuts abound,
being "more common than the robin" about Washington, says John
Burroughs.</p>

<p>All the familiar woodpeckers have two characteristics most prominently
exemplified in this red-headed member of their tribe. The hairy, the
downy, the crested, the red-bellied, the sapsucker, and the flicker
have each a red mark somewhere about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg_54]</a></span>
their heads as if they had been wounded there and bled a
little&mdash;some more, some less; and the figures of all of them,
from much flattening against tree-trunks, have become high-shouldered
and long-waisted.</p>

<p>The red-headed woodpecker selects, by preference, a partly decayed
tree in which to excavate a hole for its nest, because the digging is
easier, and the sawdust and chips make a softer lining than green
wood. Both male and female take turns in this hollowing-out process.
The one that is off duty is allowed "twenty minutes for refreshments,"
consisting of grubs, beetles, ripe apples or cherries, corn, or
preferably beech-nuts. At a loving call from its mate in the hollow
tree, it returns promptly to perform its share of the work, when the
carefully observed "time is up." The heap of sawdust at the bottom of
the hollow will eventually cradle from four to six glossy-white eggs.</p>

<p>This woodpecker has the thrifty habit of storing away nuts in the
knot-holes of trees, between cracks in the bark, or in decayed fence
rails&mdash;too often a convenient storehouse at which the squirrels may
help themselves. But it is the black snake that enters the nest and
eats the young family, and that is a more deadly foe than even the
sportsman or the milliner.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;Resident throughout its range.</div>

<p>The bill of the woodpecker is a hammering tool, well fitted for its
work. Its mission in life is to rid the trees of insects,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg_55]</a></span>
which hide beneath the bark, and with this end in view, the bird is
seen clinging to the trunks and branches of trees through fair and
wintry weather, industriously scanning every inch for the well-known
signs of the boring worm or destructive fly.</p>

<p>In the autumn the male begins to excavate his winter quarters,
carrying or throwing out the chips, by which this good workman is
known, with his beak, while the female may make herself cosey or not,
as she chooses, in an abandoned hole. About her comfort he seems
shamefully unconcerned. Intent only on his own, he drills a perfectly
round hole, usually on the under side of a limb where neither snow nor
wind can harm him, and digs out a horizontal tunnel in the dry,
brittle wood in the very heart of the tree, before turning downward
into the deep, pear-shaped chamber, where he lives in selfish
solitude. But when the nesting season comes, how devoted he is
temporarily to the mate he has neglected and even abused through the
winter! Will she never learn that after her clear-white eggs are laid
and her brood raised he will relapse into the savage and forget all
his tender wiles?</p>

<p>The hairy woodpecker, like many another bird and beast, furnishes much
doubtful weather lore for credulous and inexact observers. "When the
woodpecker pecks low on the trees, expect warm weather" is a common
saying, but when different individuals are seen pecking at the same
time, one but a few feet from the ground, and another among the high
branches, one may make the prophecy that pleases him best.</p>

<p>The hairy woodpeckers love the deep woods. They are drummers, not
singers; but when walking in the desolate winter woods even the
drumming and tapping of the busy feathered workmen on a resonant limb
is a solace, giving a sense of life and cheerful activity which is
invigorating.</p>

transversely; white underneath.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Female</i>&mdash;Similar, but without scarlet on the nape, which is white.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Range</i>&mdash;Eastern North America, from Labrador to Florida.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;Resident all the year throughout its range.</div>

<p>The downy woodpecker is similar to his big relative, the hairy
woodpecker, in color and shape, though much smaller. His outer tail
feathers are white, barred with black, but the hairy's white outer
tail feathers lack these distinguishing marks.</p>

<p>He is often called a sapsucker&mdash;though quite another bird alone merits
that name&mdash;from the supposition that he bores into the trees for the
purpose of sucking the sap; but his tongue is ill adapted for such
use, being barbed at the end, and most ornithologists consider the
charge libellous. It has been surmised that he bores the numerous
little round holes close together, so often seen, with the idea of
attracting insects to the luscious sap. The woodpeckers never drill
for insects in live wood. The downy actually drills these little holes
in apple and other trees to feed upon the inner milky bark of the
tree&mdash;the cambium layer. The only harm to be laid to his account is
that, in his zeal, he sometimes makes a ring of small holes so
continuous as to inadvertently damage the tree by girdling it. The
bird, like most others, does not debar himself entirely from fruit
diet, but enjoys berries, especially poke-berries.</p>

<p>He is very social with birds and men alike. In winter he attaches
himself to strolling bands of nuthatches and chickadees, and in summer
is fond of making friendly visits among village folk, frequenting the
shade trees of the streets and grapevines of back gardens. He has even
been known to fearlessly peck at flies on window panes.</p>

<p>In contrast to his large brother woodpecker, who is seldom drawn from
timber lands, the little downy member of the family brings the comfort
of his cheery presence to country homes, beating his rolling tattoo in
spring on some resonant limb under our windows in the garden with a
strength worthy of a larger drummer.</p>

<p>This rolling tattoo, or drumming, answers several purposes: by it he
determines whether the tree is green or hollow; it startles insects
from their lurking places underneath the bark, and it also serves as a
love song.</p>

<p>It is sad to record that this exquisitely marked woodpecker, the most
jovial and boisterous of its family, is one of the very few bird
visitors whose intimacy should be discouraged. For its useful appetite
for slugs and insects which it can take on the wing with wonderful
dexterity, it need not be wholly condemned. But as we look upon a
favorite maple or fruit tree devitalized or perhaps wholly dead from
its ravages, we cannot forget that this bird, while a most abstemious
fruit-eater, has a pernicious and most intemperate thirst for sap.
Indeed, it spends much of its time in the orchard, drilling holes into
the freshest, most vigorous trees; then, when their sap begins to
flow, it siphons it into an insatiable throat, stopping in its orgie
only long enough to snap at the insects that have been attracted to
the wounded tree by the streams of its heart-blood now trickling down
its sides. Another favorite pastime is to strip the bark off a tree,
then peck at the soft wood underneath&mdash;almost as fatal a habit. It
drills holes in maples in early spring for sap only. If it drills
holes in fruit trees it is for the cambium layer, a soft, pulpy,
nutritious under-bark.</p>

<p>These woodpeckers have a variety of call-notes, but their rapid
drumming against the limbs and trunks of trees is the sound we always
associate with them and the sound that Mr. Bicknell says is the
love-note of the family.</p>

<p>Unhappily, these birds, that many would be glad to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg_58]</a></span>
decrease in numbers, take extra precautions for the safety of their
young by making very deep excavations for their nests, often as deep
as eighteen or twenty inches.</p>

<p>The unobtrusive little chewink is not infrequently mistaken for a
robin, because of the reddish chestnut on its under parts. Careful
observation, however, shows important distinctions. It is rather
smaller and darker in color; its carriage and form are not those of
the robin, but of the finch. The female is smaller still, and has an
olive tint in her brown back. Her eggs are inconspicuous in color,
dirty white speckled with brown, and laid in a sunken nest on the
ground. Dead leaves and twigs abound, and form, as the anxious mother
fondly hopes, a safe hiding place for her brood. So careful
concealment, however, brings peril to the fledglings, for the most
cautious bird-lover may, and often does, inadvertently set his foot on
the hidden nest.</p>

<p>The chewink derives its name from the fancied resemblance of its note
to these syllables, while those naming it "towhee" hear the sound
<i>to-whick</i>, <i>to-whick</i>, <i>to-whee</i>. Its song is rich, full, and
pleasing, and given only when the bird has risen to the branches above
its low foraging ground.</p>

<p>It frequents the border of swampy places and bushy fields.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg_59]</a></span>
It is generally seen in the underbrush, picking about among the dead
leaves for its steady diet of earthworms and larv&#230; of insects,
occasionally regaling itself with a few dropping berries and fruit.</p>

<p>When startled, the bird rises not more than ten or twelve feet from
the earth, and utters its characteristic calls. On account of this
habit of flying low and grubbing among the leaves, it is sometimes
called the ground robin. In the South our modest and useful little
food-gatherer is often called grasel, especially in Louisiana, where
it is white-eyed, and is much esteemed, alas! by epicures.</p>

<p>These snowflakes (mentioned collectively, for it is impossible to
think of the bird except in great flocks) are the "true spirits of the
snowstorm," says Thoreau. They are animated beings that ride upon it,
and have their life in it. By comparison with the climate of the
arctic regions, no doubt our hardiest winter weather seems luxuriously
mild to them. We associate them only with those wonderful midwinter
days when sky, fields, and woods alike are white, and a "hard, dull
bitterness of cold" drives every other bird and beast to shelter. It
is said they often pass the night buried beneath the snow. They have
been seen to dive beneath it to escape a hawk.</p>

<p>Whirling about in the drifting snow to catch the seeds on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg_60]</a></span>
the tallest stalks that the wind in the open meadows uncovers, the
snowflakes suggest a lot of dead leaves being blown through the
all-pervading whiteness. Beautiful soft brown, gray, and predominating
black-and-white coloring distinguish these capricious visitors from
the slaty junco, the "snowbird" more commonly known. They are, indeed,
the only birds we have that are nearly white; and rarely, if ever, do
they rise far above the ground their plumage so admirably imitates.</p>

<p>At the far north, travellers have mentioned their inspiriting song,
but in the United States we hear only their cheerful twitter. Nansen
tells of seeing an occasional snow bunting in that desolation of
arctic ice where the <i>Fram</i> drifted so long.</p>

<p>A certain ornithologist tells with complacent pride of having shot
over fifty-eight rose-breasted grosbeaks in less than three weeks
(during the breeding season) to learn what kind of food they had in
their crops. This kind of devotion to science may have quite as much
to do with the growing scarcity of this bird in some localities as the
demands of the milliners, who, however, receive all of the blame for
the slaughter of our beautiful songsters. The farmers in Pennsylvania,
who, with more truth than poetry, call this the potato-bug bird, are
taking active measures, however, to protect the neighbor that is more
useful to their crop than all the insecticides known. It also eats
flies, wasps, and grubs.</p>

<p>Seen upon the ground, the dark bird is scarcely attractive with his
clumsy beak overbalancing a head that protrudes with stupid-looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg_61]</a></span>
awkwardness; but as he rises into the trees his lovely rose-colored
breast and under-wing feathers are seen, and before he has had time to
repeat his delicious, rich-voiced warble you are already in love with
him. Vibrating his wings after the manner of the mocking-bird, he
pours forth a marvellously sweet, clear, mellow song (with something
of the quality of the oriole's, robin's, and thrush's notes), making
the day on which you first hear it memorable. This is one of the few
birds that sing at night. A soft, sweet, rolling warble, heard when
the moon is at its full on a midsummer night, is more than likely to
come from the rose-breasted grosbeak.</p>

<p>It is not that his quiet little sparrow-like wife has advanced notions
of feminine independence that he takes his turn at sitting upon the
nest, but that he is one of the most unselfish and devoted of mates.
With their combined efforts they construct only a coarse, unlovely
cradle in a thorn-bush or low tree near an old, overgrown pasture lot.
The father may be the poorest of architects, but as he patiently sits
brooding over the green, speckled eggs, his beautiful rosy breast just
showing above the grassy rim, he is a sufficient adornment for any
bird's home.</p>

Perhaps none of our birds have so fitted into song and story as the
bobolink. Unlike a good child, who should "be seen and not heard," he
is heard more frequently than seen. Very shy, of peering eyes, he
keeps well out of sight in the meadow grass before entrancing our
listening ears. The bobolink never soars like the lark, as the poets
would have us believe, but generally sings on the wing, flying with a
peculiar self-conscious flight horizontally thirty or forty feet above
the meadow grass. He also sings perched upon the fence or tuft of
grass. He is one of the greatest <i>poseurs</i> among the birds.</p>

<p>In spring and early summer the bobolinks respond to every poet's
effort to imitate their notes. "Dignified 'Robert of Lincoln' is
telling his name," says one; "Spink, spank, spink," another hears him
say. But best of all are Wilson Flagg's lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">&#8230; "Now they rise and now they fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They cross and turn, and in and out,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and down the middle and wheel about,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a 'Phew, shew, Wadolincon;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">listen to me Bobolincon!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After midsummer the cares of the family have so worn upon the jollity
of our dashing, rollicking friend that his song is seldom heard. The
colors of his coat fade into a dull yellowish brown like that of his
faithful mate, who has borne the greater burden of the season, for he
has two complete moults each year.</p>

<p>The bobolinks build their nest on the ground in high grass. The eggs
are of a bluish white. Their food is largely insectivorous:
grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, spiders, with seeds of grass
especially for variety.</p>

<p>In August they begin their journey southward, flying mainly by night.
Arriving in the Southern States, they become the sad-colored,
low-voiced rice or reed bird, feeding on the rice fields, where they
descend to the ignominious fate of being dressed for the plate of the
epicure.</p>

<p>Could there be a more tragic ending to the glorious note of the gay
songster of the north?</p>

<p>A faint "<i>screep</i>, <i>screep</i>," like "the noise made by striking two
pebbles together," Audubon says, is often the only indication of the
blackpoll's presence; but surely that tireless bird-student had heard
its more characteristic notes, which, rapidly uttered, increasing in
the middle of the strain and diminishing toward the end, suggest the
shrill, wiry hum of some midsummer insect. After the opera-glass has
searched him out we find him by no means an inconspicuous bird. A
dainty little fellow, with a glossy black cap pulled over his eyes, he
is almost hidden by the dense foliage on the trees by the time he
returns to us at the very end of spring. Giraud says that he is the
very last of his tribe to come north, though the bay-breasted warbler
has usually been thought the bird to wind up the spring procession.</p>

<p>The blackpoll has a certain characteristic motion that distinguishes
him from the black-and-white creeper, for which a hasty glance might
mistake him, and from the jolly little chickadee with his black cap.
Apparently he runs about the tree-trunk, but in reality he so flits
his wings that his feet do not touch the bark at all; yet so rapidly
does he go that the flipping wing-motion is not observed. He is most
often seen in May in the apple trees, peeping into the opening
blossoms for insects, uttering now and then his slender, lisping,
brief song.</p>

<p>Vivacious, a busy hunter, often catching insects on the wing like the
flycatchers, he is a cheerful, useful neighbor the short time he
spends with us before travelling to the far north, where he mates and
nests. A nest has been found on Slide Mountain, in the Catskills, but
the hardy evergreens of Canada, and sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg_64]</a></span>
those of northern New England, are the chosen home of this little bird
that builds a nest of bits of root, lichens, and sedges, amply large
for a family twice the size of his.</p>

<p>Nine times out of ten this active little warbler is mistaken for the
downy woodpecker, not because of his coloring alone, but also on
account of their common habit of running up and down the trunks of
trees and on the under side of branches, looking for insects, on which
all the warblers subsist. But presently the true warbler
characteristic of restless flitting about shows itself. A woodpecker
would go over a tree with painstaking, systematic care, while the
black-and-white warbler, no less intent upon securing its food,
hurries off from tree to tree, wherever the most promising <i>menu</i> is
offered.</p>

<p>Clinging to the mottled bark of the tree-trunk, which he so closely
resembles, it would be difficult to find him were it not for these
sudden flittings and the feeble song, "<i>Weachy</i>, <i>weachy</i>, <i>weachy</i>,
<i>'twee</i>, <i>'twee</i>, <i>'tweet</i>," he half lisps, half sings between his
dashes after slugs. Very rarely indeed can his nest be found in an old
stump or mossy bank, where bark, leaves, and hair make the downy
cradle for his four or five tiny babies.</p>

<p>The chimney swift is, properly speaking, not a swallow at all, though
chimney swallow is its more popular name. Rowing towards the roof of
your house, as if it used first one wing, then the other, its flight,
while swift and powerful, is stiff and mechanical, unlike the
swallow's, and its entire aspect suggests a bat. The nighthawk and
whippoorwill are its relatives, and it resembles them not a little,
especially in its nocturnal habits.</p>

<p>So much fault has been found with the misleading names of many birds,
it is pleasant to record the fact that the name of the chimney swift
is everything it ought to be. No other birds can surpass and few can
equal it in its powerful flight, sometimes covering a thousand miles
in twenty-four hours, it is said, and never resting except in its
roosting places (hollow trees or chimneys of dwellings), where it does
not perch, but rather clings to the sides with its sharp claws, partly
supported by its sharper tail. Audubon tells of a certain plane tree
in Kentucky where he counted over nine thousand of these swifts
clinging to the hollow trunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg_68]</a></span>
Their nest, which is a loosely woven twig lattice, made of twigs of
trees, which the birds snap off with their beaks and carry in their
beaks, is glued with the bird's saliva or tree-gum into a solid
structure, and firmly attached to the inside of chimneys, or hollow
trees where there are no houses about. Two broods in a season usually
emerge from the pure white, elongated eggs.</p>

<p>What a twittering there is in the chimney that the swifts appropriate
after the winter fires have died out! Instead of the hospitable column
of smoke curling from the top, a cloud of sooty birds wheels and
floats above it. A sound as of distant thunder fills the chimney as a
host of these birds, startled, perhaps, by some indoor noise, whirl
their way upward. Woe betide the happy colony if a sudden cold snap in
early summer necessitates the starting of a fire on the hearth by the
unsuspecting householder! The glue being melted by the fire, "down
comes the cradle, babies and all" into the glowing embers. A
prolonged, heavy rain also causes their nests to loosen their hold and
fall with the soot to the bottom.</p>

<p>Thrifty New England housekeepers claim that bedbugs, commonly found on
bats, infest the bodies of swifts also, which is one reason why wire
netting is stretched across the chimney tops before the birds arrive
from the South.</p>

<p>If the pugnacious propensity of the kingbird is the occasion of its
royal name, he cannot be said to deserve it from any fine or noble
qualities he possesses. He is a born fighter from the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg_69]</a></span>
love of it, without provocation, rhyme, or reason. One can but watch
with a degree of admiration his bold sallies on the big, black crow or
the marauding hawk, but when he bullies the small inoffensive birds in
wanton attacks for sheer amusement, the charge is less entertaining.
Occasionally, when the little victim shows pluck and faces his
assailant, the kingbird will literally turn tail and show the white
feather. His method of attack is always when a bird is in flight; then
he swoops down from the telegraph pole or high point of vantage, and
strikes on the head or back of the neck, darting back like a flash to
the exact spot from which he started. By these tactics he avoids a
return blow and retreats from danger. He never makes a fair
hand-to-hand fight, or whatever is equivalent in bird warfare. It is a
satisfaction to record that he does not attempt to give battle to the
catbird, but whenever in view makes a grand detour to give him a wide
berth.</p>

<p>The kingbird feeds on beetles, canker-worms, and winged insects, with
an occasional dessert of berries. He is popularly supposed to prefer
the honey-bee as his favorite tidbit, but the weight of opinion is
adverse to the charge of his depopulating the beehive, even though he
owes his appellation bee martin to this tradition. One or two
ornithologists declare that he selects only the drones for his diet,
which would give him credit for marvellous sight in his rapid motion
through the air. The kingbird is preminently a bird of the garden and
orchard. The nest is open, though deep, and not carefully concealed.
Eggs are nearly round, bluish white spotted with brown and lilac. With
truly royal exclusiveness, the tyrant favors no community of interest,
but sits in regal state on a conspicuous throne, and takes his grand
flights alone or with his queen, but never with a flock of his kind.</p>

(<i>Contopus virens</i>) Flycatcher family</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Male</i>&mdash;Dusky brownish olive above, darkest on head; paler on

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;May. October. Common summer resident.</div>

<p>The wood pewee, like the olive-sided flycatcher, has wings decidedly
longer than its tail, and it is by no means a simple matter for the
novice to tell these birds apart or separate them distinctly in the
mind from the other members of a family whose coloring and habits are
most confusingly similar. This dusky haunter of tall shady trees has
not yet learned to be sociable like the ph&oelig;be; but while it may not
be so much in evidence close to our homes, it is doubtless just as
common. The orchard is as near the house as it often cares to come. An
old orchard, where modern insecticides are unknown and neglect allows
insects to riot among the decayed bark and fallen fruit, is a happy
hunting ground enough; but the bird's real preferences are decidedly
for high tree-tops in the woods, where no sunshine touches the
feathers on his dusky coat. It is one of the few shade-loving birds.
In deep solitudes, where it surely retreats by nesting time, however
neighborly it may be during the migrations, its pensive, pathetic
notes, long drawn out, seem like the expression of some hidden sorrow.
<i>Pe-a-wee</i>, <i>pe-a-wee</i>, <i>pewee-ah-peer</i> is the burden of its plaintive
song, a sound as depressing as it is familiar in every walk through
the woods, and the bird's most prominent characteristic.</p>

<p>To see the bird dashing about in his a&#235;rial chase for insects, no one
would accuse him of melancholia. He keeps an eye on the "main chance,"
whatever his preying grief may be, and never allows it to affect his
appetite. Returning to his perch after a successful sally in pursuit
of the passing fly, he repeats his "sweetly solemn thought" over and
over again all day long and every day throughout the summer.</p>

<p>The wood pewees show that devotion to each other and to their home,
characteristic of their family. Both lovers work on the construction
of the flat nest that is saddled on some mossy or lichen-covered limb,
and so cleverly do they cover the rounded edge with bits of bark and
lichen that sharp eyes only can detect where the cradle lies.
Creamy-white eggs, whose larger end is wreathed with brown and lilac
spots, are guarded with fierce solicitude.</p>

<p>Trowbridge has celebrated this bird in a beautiful poem.</p>

<p>The earliest representative of the flycatcher family to come out of
the tropics where insect life fairly swarms and teems, what does the
friendly little ph&oelig;be find to attract him to the north in March
while his prospective dinners must all be still in embryo? He looks
dejected, it is true, as he sits solitary and silent on some
projecting bare limb in the garden, awaiting the coming of his tardy
mate; nevertheless, the date of his return will not vary by more than
a few days in a given locality year after year. Why birds that are
mated for life, as these are said to be, and such devoted lovers,
should not travel together on their journey north, is another of the
many mysteries of bird-life awaiting solution.</p>

<p>The reunited, happy couple go about the garden and outbuildings like
domesticated wrens, investigating the crannies on piazzas, where
people may be coming and going, and boldly entering barn-lofts to find
a suitable site for the nest that it must take much of both time and
skill to build.</p>

<p><i>Pewit</i>, <i>ph&oelig;be</i>, <i>ph&oelig;be</i>; <i>pewit</i>, <i>ph&oelig;be</i>, they contentedly
but rather monotonously sing as they investigate all the sites in the
neighborhood. Presently a location is chosen under a beam or rafter,
and the work of collecting moss and mud for the foundation and hair
and feathers or wool to line the exquisite little home begins. But the
labor is done cheerfully, with many a sally in midair either to let
off superfluous high spirits or to catch a morsel on the wing, and
with many a vivacious outburst of what by courtesy only we may name a
song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg_72]</a></span>
When not domesticated, as these birds are rapidly becoming the
ph&oelig;bes dearly love a cool, wet woodland retreat. Here they hunt and
bathe; here they also build in a rocky bank or ledge of rocks or
underneath a bridge, but always with clever adaptation of their nest
to its surroundings, out of which it seems a natural growth. It is one
of the most finished, beautiful nests ever found.</p>

<p>A pair of ph&oelig;bes become attached to a spot where they have once
nested; they never stray far from it, and return to it regularly,
though they may not again occupy the old nest. This is because it soon
becomes infested with lice from the hen's feathers used in lining it,
for which reason too close relationship with this friendly
bird-neighbor is discouraged by thrifty housekeepers. When the baby
birds have come out from the four or six little white eggs, their
helpless bodies are mercilessly attacked by parasites, and are often
so enfeebled that half the brood die. The next season another nest
will be built near the first, the following summer still another,
until it would appear that a colony of birds had made their homes in
the place.</p>

<p>Throughout the long summer&mdash;for as the ph&oelig;be is the first
flycatcher to come, so it is the last to go&mdash;the bird is a tireless
hunter of insects, which it catches on the wing with a sharp click of
its beak, like the other members of its dexterous family.</p>

the tail that the Eastern ph&oelig;be indulges in when excited. This bird

<p>The most dignified and handsomely dressed member of his family, the
crested flycatcher has, nevertheless, an air of pensive melancholy
about him when in repose that can be accounted for only by the pain he
must feel every time he hears himself screech. His harsh, shrill call,
louder and more disagreeable than the kingbird's, cannot but rasp his
ears as it does ours. And yet it is chiefly by this piercing note,
given with a rising inflection, that we know the bird is in our
neighborhood; for he is somewhat of a recluse, and we must often
follow the disagreeable noise to its source in the tree-tops before we
can catch a glimpse of the screecher. Perched on a high lookout, he
appears morose and sluggish, in spite of his aristocratic-looking
crest, trim figure, and feathers that must seem rather gay to one of
his dusky tribe. A low soliloquy, apparently born of discontent, can
be overheard from the foot of his tree. But another second, and he has
dashed off in hot pursuit of an insect flying beyond our sight, and
with extremely quick, dexterous evolutions in midair, he finishes the
hunt with a sharp click of his bill as it closes over the unhappy
victim, and then he returns to his perch. On the wing he is
exceedingly active and joyous; in the tree he appears just the
reverse. That he is a domineering fellow, quite as much of a tyrant as
the notorious kingbird, that bears the greater burden of opprobrium,
is shown in the fierce way he promptly dashes at a feathered stranger
that may have alighted too near his perch, and pursues it beyond the
bounds of justice, all the while screaming his rasping cry into the
intruder's ears, that must pierce as deep as the thrusts from his
relentless beak. He has even been known to drive off woodpeckers and
bluebirds from the hollows in the trees that he, like them, chooses
for a nest, and appropriate the results of their labor for his
scarcely less belligerent mate. With a slight but important and
indispensable addition, the stolen nest is ready to receive her four
cream-colored eggs, that look as if a pen dipped in purple ink had
been scratched over them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg_74]</a></span></p>
<p>The fact that gives the great-crested flycatcher a unique interest
among all North American birds is that it invariably lines its nest
with snake-skins if one can be had. Science would scarcely be worth
the studying if it did not set our imaginations to work delving for
plausible reasons for Nature's strange doings. Most of us will
doubtless agree with Wilson (who made a special study of these
interesting nests and never found a single one without cast
snake-skins in it, even in districts where snakes were so rare they
were supposed not to exist at all), that the lining was chosen to
terrorize all intruders. The scientific mind that is unwilling to
dismiss any detail of Nature's work as merely arbitrary and haphazard,
is greatly exercised over the reason for the existence of crests on
birds. But, surely, may not the sight of snake-skins that first greet
the eyes of the fledgling flycatchers as they emerge from the shell be
a good and sufficient reason why the feathers on their little heads
should stand on end? "In the absence of a snake-skin, I have found an
onion skin and shad scales in the nest," says John Burroughs, who
calls this bird "the wild Irishman of the flycatchers."</p>

tufts of feathers on its flanks. Its habits have the family
characteristics: it takes its food on the wing, suddenly sallying
forth from its perch, darting about midair to seize its prey, then as
suddenly returning to its identical point of vantage, usually in some
distended, dead limb in the tree-top; it is pugnacious, bold, and
tyrannical; mopish and inert when not on the hunt, but wonderfully
alert and swift when in pursuit of insect or feathered foe. The short
necks of the flycatchers make their heads appear large for their
bodies, a peculiarity slightly emphasized in this member of the
family.</p>

<p>High up in some evergreen tree, well out on a branch, over which the
shapeless mass of twigs and moss that serves as a nest is saddled,
four or five buff-speckled eggs are laid, and by some special

whistle, <i>wheu&mdash;o-wheu-o-wheu-o</i>, rings out from the throat of this
olive-sided tyrant, warning all intruders off the premises; but
however harshly he may treat the rest of the feathered world, he has

<p>This, the smallest member of its family, takes the place of the more
southerly Acadian flycatcher, throughout New England and the region of
the Great Lakes. But, unlike his Southern relative, he prefers
orchards and gardens close to our homes for his hunting grounds rather
than the wet recesses of the forests. <i>Che-bec</i>, <i>che-bec</i>, the
diminutive olive-pated gray sprite calls out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg_76]</a></span>
from the orchard between his arial sallies after the passing insects
that have been attracted by the decaying fruit, and chebec is the name
by which many New Englanders know him.</p>

<p>While giving this characteristic call-note, with drooping jerking
tail, trembling wings, and uplifted parti-colored bill, he, looks
unnerved and limp by the effort it has cost him. But in the next
instant a gnat flies past. How quickly the bird recovers itself, and
charges full-tilt at his passing dinner! The sharp click of his little
bill proves that he has not missed his aim; and after careering about
in the air another minute or two, looking for more game to snap up on
the wing, he will return to the same perch and take up his familiar
refrain. Without hearing this call-note one might often mistake the
bird for either the wood pewee or the ph&oelig;be, for all the three are
similarly clothed and have many traits in common. The slightly larger
size of the ph&oelig;be and pewee is not always apparent when they are
seen perching on the trees. Unlike the "tuft of hay" to which the
Acadian flycatcher's nest has been likened, the least flycatcher's
home is a neat, substantial cup-shaped cradle softly lined with down
or horsehair, and placed generally in an upright crotch of a tree,
well above the ground.</p>

<p>No "fair weather friend" is the jolly little chickadee. In the depth
of the autumn equinoctial storm it returns to the tops of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg_77]</a></span>
the trees close by the house, where, through the sunshine, snow, and
tempest of the entire winter, you may hear its cheery, irrepressible
<i>chickadee-dee-dee-dee</i> or <i>day-day-day</i> as it swings around the
dangling cones of the evergreens. It fairly overflows with good
spirits, and is never more contagiously gay than in a snowstorm. So
active, so friendly and cheering, what would the long northern winters
be like without this lovable little neighbor?</p>

<p>It serves a more utilitarian purpose, however, than bracing
faint-hearted spirits. "There is no bird that compares with it in
destroying the female canker-worm moths and their eggs," writes a
well-known entomologist. He calculates that as a chickadee destroys
about 5,500 eggs in one day, it will eat 138,750 eggs in the
twenty-five days it takes the canker-worm moth to crawl up the trees.
The moral that it pays to attract chickadees about your home by
feeding them in winter is obvious. Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright, in her
delightful and helpful book "Birdcraft," tells us how she makes a sort
of a bird-hash of finely minced raw meat, waste canary-seed,
buckwheat, and cracked oats, which she scatters in a sheltered spot
for all the winter birds. The way this is consumed leaves no doubt of
its popularity. A raw bone, hung from an evergreen limb, is equally
appreciated.</p>

<p>Friendly as the chickadee is&mdash;and Dr. Abbott declares it the tamest
bird we have&mdash;it prefers well-timbered districts, especially where
there are red-bud trees, when it is time to nest. It is very often
clever enough to leave the labor of hollowing out a nest in the
tree-trunk to the woodpecker or nuthatch, whose old homes it readily
appropriates; or, when these birds object, a knot-hole or a hollow
fence-rail answers every purpose. Here, in the summer woods, when
family cares beset it, a plaintive, minor whistle replaces the
<i>chickadee-dee-dee</i> that Thoreau likens to "silver tinkling" as he
heard it on a frosty morning.</p>

<p>"A noisy titmouse is Jack Frost's trumpeter" may be one of those few
weather-wise proverbs with a grain of truth in them. As the chickadee
comes from the woods with the frost, so it may be noticed his cousin,
the crested titmouse, is in more noisy evidence throughout the winter.</p>

<p>One might sometimes think his whistle, like a tugboat's, worked by
steam. But how effectually nesting cares alone can silence it in
April!</p>

<p>Titmice always see to it you are not lonely as you walk through the
woods. This lordly tomtit, with his jaunty crest, keeps up a
persistent whistle at you as he flits from tree to tree, leading you
deeper into the forest, calling out "<i>Here-here-here!</i>" and looking
like a pert and jaunty little blue jay, minus his gay clothes. Mr.
Nehrling translates one of the calls "<i>Heedle-dee-dle-dee-dle-dee!</i>"
and another "<i>Peto-peto-peto-daytee-daytee!</i>" But it is at the former,
sharply whistled as the crested titmouse gives it, that every dog
pricks up his ears.</p>

<p>Comparatively little has been written about this bird, because it is
not often found in New England, where most of the bird <i>litterateurs</i>
have lived. South of New York State, however, it is a common resident,
and much respected for the good work it does in destroying injurious
insects, though it is more fond of varying its diet with nuts,
berries, and seeds than that all-round benefactor, the chickadee.</p>

<p>The Canada jay looks like an exaggerated chickadee, and both birds are
equally fond of bitter cold weather, but here the similarity stops
short. Where the chickadee is friendly the jay is impudent and bold;
hardly less of a villain than his blue relative when it comes to
marauding other birds' nests and destroying their young. With all his
vices, however, intemperance cannot be attributed to him, in spite of
the name given him by the Adirondack lumbermen and guides. "Whisky
John" is a purely innocent corruption of "Wis-ka-tjon," as the Indians
call this bird that haunts their camps and familiarly enters their
wigwams. The numerous popular names by which the Canada jays are known
are admirably accounted for by Mr. Hardy in a bulletin issued by the
Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<p>"They will enter the tents, and often alight on the bow of a canoe,
where the paddle at every stroke comes within eighteen inches of them.
I know nothing which can be eaten that they will not take, and I had
one steal all my candles, pulling them out endwise, one by one, from a
piece of birch bark in which they were rolled, and another peck a
large hole in a keg of castile soap. A duck which I had picked and
laid down for a few minutes, had the entire breast eaten out by one or
more of these birds. I have seen one alight in the middle of my canoe
and peck away at the carcass of a beaver I had skinned. They often
spoil deer saddles by pecking into them near the kidneys. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg_80]</a></span>
do great damage to the trappers by stealing the bait from traps set for
martens and minks and by eating trapped game. They will sit quietly
and see you build a log trap and bait it, and then, almost before your
back is turned, you hear their hateful <i>ca-ca-ca!</i> as they glide down
and peer into it. They will work steadily, carrying off meat and
hiding it. I have thrown out pieces, and watched one to see how much
he would carry off. He flew across a wide stream, and in a short time
looked as bloody as a butcher from carrying large pieces; but his
patience held out longer than mine. I think one would work as long as
Mark Twain's California jay did trying to fill a miner's cabin with
acorns through a knot-hole in the roof. They are fond of the berries
of the mountain ash, and, in fact, few things come amiss; I believe
they do not possess a single good quality except industry."</p>

<p>One virtue not mentioned by Mr. Hardy is their prudent saving from the
summer surplus to keep the winter storeroom well supplied like a
squirrel's. Such thrift is the more necessary when a clamorous, hungry
family of young jays must be reared while the thermometer is often as
low as thirty degrees below zero at the end of March. How eggs are
ever hatched at all in a temperature calculated to freeze any sitting
bird stiff, is one of the mysteries of the woods. And yet four or five
fluffy little jays, that look as if they were dressed in gray fur,
emerge from the eggs before the spring sunshine has unbound the icy
rivers or melted the snowdrifts piled high around the evergreens.</p>

Our familiar catbird, of all the feathered tribe, presents the most
contrary characteristics, and is therefore held in varied
estimation&mdash;loved, admired, ridiculed, abused. He is the veriest "Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" of birds. Exquisitely proportioned, with finely
poised black head and satin-gray coat, which he bathes most carefully
and prunes and prinks by the hour, he appears from his toilet a Beau
Brummell, an aristocratic-looking, even dandified neighbor. Suddenly,
as if shot, he drops head and tail and assumes the most hang-dog air,
without the least sign of self-respect; then crouches and lengthens
into a roll, head forward and tail straightened, till he looks like a
little, short gray snake, lank and limp. Anon, with a jerk and a
sprint, every muscle tense, tail erect, eyes snapping, he darts into
the air intent upon some well-planned mischief. It is impossible to
describe his various attitudes or moods. In song and call he presents
the same opposite characteristics. How such a bird, exquisite in
style, can demean himself to utter such harsh, altogether hateful
catcalls and squawks as have given the bird his common name, is a
wonder when in the next moment his throat swells and beginning
<i>phut-phut-coquillicot</i>, he gives forth a long glorious song, only
second to that of the wood thrush in melody. He is a jester, a
caricaturist, a mocking-bird.</p>

<p>The catbird's nest is like a veritable scrap-basket, loosely woven of
coarse twigs, bits of newspaper, scraps, and rags, till this rough
exterior is softly lined and made fit to receive the four to six
pretty dark green-blue eggs to be laid therein.</p>

<p>As a fruit thief harsh epithets are showered upon the friendly,
confiding little creature at our doors; but surely his depredations
may be pardoned, for he is industrious at all times and unusually
adroit in catching insects, especially in the moth stage.</p>

<p>North of Delaware this commonest of Southern birds is all too rarely
seen outside of cages, yet even in midwinter it is not unknown in
Central Park, New York. This is the angel that it is said the catbird
was before he fell from grace. Slim, neat, graceful, imitative,
amusing, with a rich, tender song that only the thrush can hope to
rival, and with an instinctive preference for the society of man, it
is little wonder he is a favorite, caged or free. He is a most devoted
parent, too, when the four or six speckled green eggs have produced as
many mouths to be supplied with insects and berries.</p>

<p>In the Connecticut Valley, where many mocking-birds' nests have been
found, year after year, they are all seen near the ground, and without
exception are loosely, poorly constructed affairs of leaves, feathers,
grass, and even rags.</p>

<p>With all his virtues, it must be added, however, that this charming
bird is a sad tease. There is no sound, whether made by bird or beast
about him, that he cannot imitate so clearly as to deceive every one
but himself. Very rarely can you find a mocking-bird without
intelligence and mischief enough to appreciate his ventriloquism. In
Sidney Lanier's college note-book was found written this reflection:
"A poet is the mocking-bird of the spiritual universe. In him are
collected all the individual songs of all individual natures." Later
in life, with the same thought in mind, he referred to the bird as
"yon slim Shakespeare on the tree." His exquisite stanzas, "To Our
Mocking-bird," exalt the singer with the immortals:</p>

<p>"Leaden skies above; snow below," is Mr. Parkhurst's suggestive
description of this rather timid little neighbor, that is only starved
into familiarity. When the snow has buried seed and berries, a flock
of juncos, mingling sociably with the sparrows and chickadees about
the kitchen door, will pick up scraps of food with an intimacy quite
touching in a bird naturally rather shy. Here we can readily
distinguish these "little gray-robed monks and nuns," as Miss Florence
Merriam calls them.</p>

<p>They are trim, sprightly, sleek, and even natty; their dispositions
are genial and vivacious, not quarrelsome, like their sparrow cousins,
and what is perhaps best about them, they are birds we may surely
depend upon seeing in the winter months. A few come forth in
September, migrating at night from the deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg_84]</a></span>
woods of the north, where they have nested and moulted during the
summer; but not until frost has sharpened the air are large numbers of
them seen. Rejoicing in winter, they nevertheless do not revel in the
deep and fierce arctic blasts, as the snowflakes do, but take good
care to avoid the open pastures before the hard storms overtake them.</p>

<p>Early in the spring their song is sometimes heard before they leave us
to woo and to nest in the north. Mr. Bicknell describes it as "a crisp
call-note, a simple trill, and a faint, whispered warble, usually much
broken, but not without sweetness."</p>

With more artless inquisitiveness than fear, this lively little
acrobat stops his hammering or hatcheting at your approach, and
stretching himself out from the tree until it would seem he must fall
off, he peers down at you, head downward, straight into your upturned
opera-glasses. If there is too much snow on the upper side of a
branch, watch how he runs along underneath it like a fly, busily
tapping the bark, or adroitly breaking the decayed bits with his bill,
as he searches for the spider's eggs, larv&#230;, etc., hidden there; yet
somehow, between mouthfuls, managing to call out his cheery <i>quank!</i>
<i>quank!</i> <i>hank!</i> <i>hank!</i></p>

<p>Titmice and nuthatches, which have many similar characteristics, are
often seen in the most friendly hunting parties on the same tree. A
pine woods is their dearest delight. There, as the mercury goes down,
their spirits only seem to go up higher. In the spring they have been
thought by many to migrate in flocks, whereas they are only retreating
with their relations away from the haunts of men to the deep, cool
woods, where they nest. With infinite patience the nuthatch excavates
a hole in a tree, lining it with feathers and moss, and often
depositing as many as ten white eggs (speckled with red and lilac) for
a single brood.</p>

the other and larger nuthatch, with whom it is usually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg_86]</a></span>
seen, for the winter birds have a delightfully social manner, so that
a colony of these Free masons is apt to contain not only both kinds of
nuthatches and chickadees, but kinglets and brown creepers as well. It
shares the family habit of walking about the trees, head downward, and
running along the under side of limbs like a fly. By Thanksgiving Day
the <i>quank!</i> <i>quank!</i> of the white-breasted species is answered by the
<i>tai-tai-tait!</i> of the red-breasted cousin in the orchard, where the

insects' eggs, and oily seeds from the evergreen trees.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Male and Female</i>&mdash;Upper parts gray; narrow black line across

<p>It is not easy, even at a slight distance, to distinguish the
loggerhead from the Northern shrike. Both have the pernicious habit of
killing insects and smaller birds and impaling them on thorns; both
have the peculiarity of flying, with strong, vigorous flight and much
wing-flapping, close along the ground, then suddenly rising to a tree,
on the lookout for prey. Their harsh, unmusical call-notes are similar
too, and their hawk-like method of dropping suddenly upon a victim on
the ground below is identical. Indeed, the same description very
nearly answers for both birds. But there is one very important
difference. While the Northern shrike is a winter visitor, the
loggerhead, being his Southern counterpart, does not arrive until
after the frost is out of the ground, and he can be sure of a truly
warm welcome. A lesser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg_87]</a></span>
distinction between the only two representatives of the shrike family
that frequent our neighborhood&mdash;and they are two too
many&mdash;is in the smaller size of the loggerhead and its
lighter-gray plumage. But as both these birds select some high,
commanding position, like a distended branch near the tree-top, a
cupola, house-peak, lightning-rod, telegraph wire, or weather-vane,
the better to detect a passing dinner, it would be quite impossible
at such a distance to know which shrike was sitting up there silently
plotting villainies, without remembering the season when each may be
expected.</p> <br />

<p>"Matching the bravest of the brave among birds of prey in deeds of
daring, and no less relentless than reckless, the shrike compels that
sort of deference, not unmixed with indignation, we are accustomed to
accord to creatures of seeming insignificance whose exploits demand
much strength, great spirit, and insatiate love for carnage. We cannot
be indifferent to the marauder who takes his own wherever he finds
it&mdash;a feudal baron who holds his own with undisputed sway&mdash;and an ogre
whose victims are so many more than he can eat, that he actually keeps
a private graveyard for the balance." Who is honestly able to give the
shrikes a better character than Dr. Coues, just quoted? A few offer
them questionable defence by recording the large numbers of English sparrows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg_88]</a></span>
they kill in a season, as if wanton carnage were ever
justifiable.</p>

<p>Not even a hawk itself can produce the consternation among a flock of
sparrows that the harsh, rasping voice of the butcher-bird creates,
for escape they well know to be difficult before the small ogre swoops
down upon his victim, and carries it off to impale it on a thorn or
frozen twig, there to devour it later piecemeal. Every shrike thus
either impales or else hangs up, as a butcher does his meat, more
little birds of many kinds, field-mice, grasshoppers, and other large
insects than it can hope to devour in a week of bloody orgies.
Field-mice are perhaps its favorite diet, but even snakes are not
disdained.</p>

<p>More contemptible than the actual slaughter of its victims, if
possible, is the method by which the shrike often lures and sneaks
upon his prey. Hiding in a clump of bushes in the meadow or garden, he
imitates with fiendish cleverness the call-notes of little birds that
come in cheerful response, hopping and flitting within easy range of
him. His bloody work is finished in a trice. Usually, however, it must
be owned, the shrike's hunting habits are the reverse of sneaking.
Perched on a point of vantage on some tree-top or weather-vane, his
hawk-like eye can detect a grasshopper going through the grass fifty
yards away.</p>

<p>What is our surprise when some fine warm day in March, just before our
butcher, ogre, sneak, and fiend leaves us for colder regions, to hear
him break out into song! Love has warmed even his cold heart, and with
sweet, warbled notes on the tip of a beak that but yesterday was
reeking with his victim's blood, he starts for Canada, leaving behind
him the only good impression he has made during a long winter's visit.</p>

<p>When Charles Bonaparte, Prince of Canino, who was the first to count
this common waxwing of Europe and Asia among the birds of North
America, published an account of it in his "Synopsis," it was
considered a very rare bird indeed. It may be these waxwings have
greatly increased, but however uncommon they may still be considered,
certainly no one who had ever seen a flock containing more than a
thousand of them, resting on the trees of a lawn within sight of New
York City, as the writer has done, could be expected to consider the
birds "very rare."</p>

<p>The Bohemian waxwing, like the only other member of the family that
ever visits us, the cedar-bird, is a roving gipsy. In Germany they say
seven years must elapse between its visitations, which the
superstitious old cronies are wont to associate with woful stories of
pestilence&mdash;just such tales as are resurrected from the depths of
morbid memories here when a comet reappears or the seven-year locust
ascends from the ground.</p>

<p>The goings and comings of these birds are certainly most erratic and
infrequent; nevertheless, when hunger drives them from the far north
to feast upon the juniper and other winter berries of our Northern
States, they come in enormous flocks, making up in quantity what they
lack in regularity of visits and evenness of distribution.</p>

<p>Surely no bird has less right to be associated with evil than this
mild waxwing. It seems the very incarnation of peace and harmony. Part
of a flock that has lodged in a tree will sit almost motionless for
hours and whisper in softly hissed twitterings, very much as a company
of Quaker ladies, similarly dressed, might sit at yearly meeting.
Exquisitely clothed in silky-gray feathers that no berry juice is ever
permitted to stain, they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg_90]</a></span>
dainty, gentle, aristocratic-looking birds, a trifle heavy and
indolent, perhaps, when walking on the ground or perching; but as they
fly in compact squads just above the tree-tops their flight is
exceedingly swift and graceful.</p>

<p>In the Alleghanies, and from New Jersey and Illinois northward, this
restless little warbler nests in the bushy borders of woodlands and
the undergrowth of the woods, for which he forsakes our gardens and
orchards after a very short visit in May. While hopping over the
ground catching ants, of which he seems to be inordinately fond, or
flitting actively about the shrubbery after grubs and insects, we may
note his coat of many colors&mdash;patchwork in which nearly all the
warbler colors are curiously combined. With drooped wings that often
conceal the bird's chestnut sides, which are his chief distinguishing
mark, and with tail erected like a redstart's, he hunts incessantly.
Here in the garden he is as refreshingly indifferent to your interest
in him as later in his breeding haunts he is shy and distrustful. His
song is bright and animated, like that of the yellow warbler.</p>

<p>After one has seen a golden-winged warbler fluttering hither and
thither about the shrubbery of a park within sight and sound of a
great city's distractions and with blissful unconcern of them all,
partaking of a hearty lunch of insects that infest the leaves before
one's eyes, one counts the bird less rare and shy than one has been
taught to consider it. Whoever looks for a warbler with gaudy yellow
wings will not find the golden-winged variety. His wings have golden
patches only, and while these are distinguishing marks, they are
scarcely prominent enough features to have given the bird the rather
misleading name he bears. But, then, most warblers' names are
misleading. They serve their best purpose in cultivating patience and
other gentle virtues in the novice.</p>

States all the winter.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;April. October. November. Also, but more rarely,
a winter resident.</div>

<p>The first of the warblers to arrive in the spring and the last to
leave us in the autumn, some even remaining throughout the northern
winter, the myrtle warbler, next to the summer yellowbird, is the most
familiar of its multitudinous kin. Though we become acquainted with it
chiefly in the migrations, it impresses us by its numbers rather than
by any gorgeousness of attire. The four yellow spots on crown, lower
back, and sides are its distinguishing marks; and in the autumn these
marks have dwindled to only one, that on the lower back or rump. The
great difficulty experienced in identifying any warbler is in its
restless habit of flitting about.</p>

<p>For a few days in early May we are forcibly reminded of the Florida
peninsula, which fairly teems with these birds; they become almost
superabundant, a distraction during the precious days when the rarer
species are quietly slipping by, not to return again for a year,
perhaps longer, for some warblers are notoriously irregular in their
routes north and south, and never return by the way they travelled in
the spring.</p>

<p>But if we look sharply into every group of myrtle warblers, we are
quite likely to discover some of their dainty, fragile cousins that
gladly seek the escort of birds so fearless as they. By the last of
May all the warblers are gone from the neighborhood except the
constant little summer yellowbird and redstart.</p>

<p>In autumn, when the myrtle warblers return after a busy enough summer
passed in Canadian nurseries, they chiefly haunt those regions where
juniper and bay-berries abound. These latter (<i>Myrica cerifera</i>), or
the myrtle wax-berries, as they are sometimes called, and which are
the bird's favorite food, have given it their name. Wherever the
supply of these berries is sufficient to last through the winter,
there it may be found foraging in the scrubby bushes. Sometimes driven
by cold and hunger from the fields, this hardiest member of a family
that properly belongs to the tropics, seeks shelter and food close to
the outbuildings on the farm.</p>

<p>Through an open window of an apartment in the very heart of New York
City, a parula warbler flew this spring of 1897, surely the daintiest,
most exquisitely beautiful bird visitor that ever voluntarily lodged
between two brick walls.</p>

<p>A number of such airy, tiny beauties flitting about among the blossoms
of the shrubbery on a bright May morning and swaying on the slenderest
branches with their inimitable grace, is a sight that the memory
should retain into old age. They seem the very embodiment of life,
joy, beauty, grace; of everything lovely that birds by any possibility
could be. Apparently they are wafted about the garden; they fly with
no more effort than a dainty lifting of the wings, as if to catch the
breeze, that seems to lift them as it might a bunch of thistledown.
They go through a great variety of charming posturings as they hunt
for their food upon the blossoms and tender fresh twigs, now creeping
like a nuthatch along the bark and peering into the crevices, now
gracefully swaying and balancing like a goldfinch upon a slender,
pendent stem. One little sprite pauses in its hunt for the insects to
raise its pretty head and trill a short and wiry song.</p>

<p>But the parula warbler does not remain long about the gardens and
orchards, though it will not forsake us altogether for the Canadian
forests, where most of its relatives pass the summer. It retreats only
to the woods near the water, if may be, or to just as close a
counterpart of a swampy southern woods, where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg_95]</a></span>
Spanish or Usnea "moss" drapes itself over the cypresses, as it can
find here at the north. Its rarely beautiful nest, that hangs
suspended from a slender branch very much like the Baltimore oriole's,
is so woven and festooned with this moss that its concealment is
perfect.</p>

<p>Whoever looks for this beautifully marked warbler among the bluebirds,
will wish that the man who named him had possessed a truer eye for
color. But if the name so illy fits the bright slate-colored male, how
grieved must be his little olive-and-yellow mate to answer to the name
of black-throated blue warbler when she has neither a black throat nor
a blue feather! It is not easy to distinguish her as she flits about
the twigs and leaves of the garden in May or early autumn, except as
she is seen in company with her husband, whose name she has taken with
him for better or for worse. The white spot on the wings should always
be looked for to positively identify this bird.</p>

<p>Before flying up to a twig to peck off the insects, the birds have a
pretty vireo trick of cocking their heads on one side to investigate
the quantity hidden underneath the leaves. They seem less nervous and
more deliberate than many of their restless family.</p>

<p>Most warblers go over the Canada border to nest, but there are many
records of the nests of this species in the Alleghanies as far south
as Georgia, in the Catskills, in Connecticut, northern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg_96]</a></span>
Minnesota and Michigan. Laurel thickets and moist undergrowth of woods
in the United States, and more commonly pine woods in Canada, are the
favorite nesting haunts. A sharp <i>zip</i>, <i>zip</i>, like some midsummer
insect's noise, is the bird's call-note, but its love-song, <i>zee</i>,
<i>zee</i>, <i>zee</i>, or <i>twee</i>, <i>twea</i>, <i>twea-e-e</i>, as one authority writes
it, is only rarely heard in the migrations. It is a languid, drawling
little strain, with an upward slide that is easily drowned in the full
bird chorus of May.</p>

<p>With the first soft, plaintive warble of the bluebirds early in March,
the sugar camps, waiting for their signal, take on a bustling
activity; the farmer looks to his plough; orders are hurried off to
the seedsmen; a fever to be out of doors seizes one: spring is here.
Snowstorms may yet whiten fields and gardens, high winds may howl
about the trees and chimneys, but the little blue heralds persistently
proclaim from the orchard and garden that the spring procession has
begun to move. <i>Tru-al-ly</i>, <i>tru-al-ly</i>, they sweetly assert to our
incredulous ears.</p>

<p>The bluebird is not always a migrant, except in the more northern
portions of the country. Some representatives there are always with
us, but the great majority winter south and drop out of the spring
procession on its way northward, the males a little ahead of their
mates, which show housewifely instincts immediately after their
arrival. A pair of these rather undemonstrative, matter-of-fact lovers
go about looking for some deserted woodpecker's hole in the orchard,
peering into cavities in the fence-rails,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg_100]</a></span>
or into the bird-houses that, once set up in the old-fashioned gardens
for their special benefit, are now appropriated too often by the
ubiquitous sparrow. Wrens they can readily dispossess of an attractive
tenement, and do. With a temper as heavenly as the color of their
feathers, the bluebird's sense of justice is not always so adorable.
But sparrows unnerve them into cowardice. The comparatively infrequent
nesting of the bluebirds about our homes at the present time is one of
the most deplorable results of unrestricted sparrow immigration.
Formerly they were the commonest of bird neighbors.</p>

<p>Nest-building is not a favorite occupation with the bluebirds, that
are conspicuously domestic none the less. Two, and even three, broods
in a season fully occupy their time. As in most cases, the mother-bird
does more than her share of the work. The male looks with wondering
admiration at the housewifely activity, applauds her with song, feeds
her as she sits brooding over the nestful of pale greenish-blue eggs,
but his adoration of her virtues does not lead him into emulation.</p>

<p>Lowell observed that he carried his duties quite as lightly.</p>

<p>When the young birds first emerge from the shell they are almost
black; they come into their splendid heritage of color by degrees,
lest their young heads might be turned. It is only as they spread
their tiny wings for their first flight from the nest that we can see
a few blue feathers.</p>

<p>With the first cool days of autumn the bluebirds collect in flocks,
often associating with orioles and kingbirds in sheltered, sunny
places where insects are still plentiful. Their steady, undulating
flight now becomes erratic as they take food on the wing&mdash;a habit that
they may have learned by association with the kingbirds, for they have
also adopted the habit of perching upon some conspicuous lookout and
then suddenly launching out into the air for a passing fly and
returning to their perch. Long after their associates have gone
southward, they linger like the last leaves on the tree. It is indeed
"good-bye to summer" when the bluebirds withdraw their touch of
brightness from the dreary November landscape.</p>

<p>The bluebirds from Canada and the northern portions of New

<p>The "glowing indigo" of this tropical-looking visitor that so
delighted Thoreau in the Walden woods, often seems only the more
intense by comparison with the blue sky, against which it stands out
in relief as the bird perches singing in a tree-top. What has this
gaily dressed, dapper little cavalier in common with his dingy sparrow
cousins that haunt the ground and delight in dust-baths, leaving their
feathers no whit more dingy than they were before, and in temper, as
in plumage, suggesting more of earth than of heaven? Apparently he has
nothing, and yet the small brown bird in the roadside thicket, which
you have misnamed a sparrow, not noticing the glint of blue in her
shoulders and tail, is his mate. Besides the structural resemblances,
which are, of course, the only ones considered by ornithologists in
classifying birds, the indigo buntings have several sparrow-like
traits. They feed upon the ground, mainly upon seeds of grasses and
herbs, with a few insects interspersed to give relish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg_102]</a></span>
to the grain; they build grassy nests in low bushes or tall, rank
grass; and their flight is short and labored. Borders of woods,
roadside thickets, and even garden shrubbery, with open pasture lots
for foraging grounds near by, are favorite haunts of these birds, that
return again and again to some preferred spot. But however close to
our homes they build theirs, our presence never ceases to be regarded
by them with anything but suspicion, not to say alarm. Their metallic
<i>cheep</i>, <i>cheep</i>, warns you to keep away from the little blue-white
eggs, hidden away securely in the bushes; and the nervous tail
twitchings and jerkings are pathetic to see. Happily for the safety of
their nest, the brooding mother has no tell-tale feathers to attract
the eye. Dense foliage no more conceals the male bird's brilliant coat
than it can the tanager's or oriole's.</p>

<p>With no attempt at concealment, which he doubtless understands would
be quite impossible, he chooses some high, conspicuous perch to which
he mounts by easy stages, singing as he goes; and there begins a loud
and rapid strain that promises much, but growing weaker and weaker,
ends as if the bird were either out of breath or too weak to finish.
Then suddenly he begins the same song over again, and keeps up this
continuous performance for nearly half an hour. The noonday heat of an
August day that silences nearly every other voice, seems to give to
the indigo bird's only fresh animation and timbre.</p>

<p>If the kingfisher is not so neighborly as we could wish, or as he used
to be, it is not because he has grown less friendly, but because the
streams near our homes are fished out. Fish he must and will have, and
to get them nowadays it is too often necessary to follow the stream
back through secluded woods to the quiet waters of its source: a
clear, cool pond or lake whose scaly inmates have not yet learned
wisdom at the point of the sportsman's fly.</p>

<p>In such quiet haunts the kingfisher is easily the most conspicuous
object in sight, where he perches on some dead or projecting branch
over the water, intently watching for a dinner that is all
unsuspectingly swimming below. Suddenly the bird drops&mdash;dives; there
is a splash, a struggle, and then the "lone fisherman" returns
triumphant to his perch, holding a shining fish in his beak. If the
fish is small it is swallowed at once, but if it is large and bony it
must first be killed against the branch. A few sharp knocks, and the
struggles of the fish are over, but the kingfisher's have only begun.
How he gags and writhes, swallows his dinner, and then, regretting his
haste, brings it up again to try another wider avenue down his throat!
The many abortive efforts he makes to land his dinner safely below in
his stomach, his grim contortions as the fishbones scratch his
throat-lining on their way down and up again, force a smile in spite
of the bird's evident distress. It is small wonder he supplements his
fish diet with various kinds of the larger insects, shrimps, and
fresh-water mollusks.</p>

<p>Flying well over the tree-tops or along the waterways, the kingfisher
makes the woodland echo with his noisy rattle, that breaks the
stillness like a watchman's at midnight. It is, perhaps, the most
familiar sound heard along the banks of the inland rivers. No love or
cradle song does he know. Instead of softening and growing sweet, as
the voices of most birds do in the nesting season, the endearments
uttered by a pair of mated kingfishers are the most strident, rattly
shrieks ever heard by lovers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg_104]</a></span>
It sounds as if they were perpetually quarrelling, and yet they are
really particularly devoted.</p>

<p>The nest of these birds, like the bank swallow's, is excavated in the
face of a high bank, preferably one that rises from a stream; and at
about six feet from the entrance of the tunnel six or eight clear,
shining white eggs are placed on a curious nest. All the fishbones and
scales that, being indigestible, are disgorged in pellets by the
parents, are carefully carried to the end of the tunnel to form a
prickly cradle for the unhappy fledglings. Very rarely a nest is made
in the hollow trunk of a tree; but wherever the home is, the
kingfishers become strongly attached to it, returning again and again
to the spot that has cost them so much labor to excavate. Some
observers have accused them of appropriating the holes of the
water-rats.</p>

<p>In ancient times of myths and fables, kingfishers or halcyons were
said to build a floating nest on the sea, and to possess some
mysterious power that calmed the troubled waves while the eggs were
hatching and the young birds were being reared, hence the term
"halcyon days," meaning days of fair weather.</p>

<p>No bird of finer color or presence sojourns with us the year round
than the blue jay. In a peculiar sense his is a case of "beauty
covering a multitude of sins." Among close students of bird traits, we
find none so poor as to do him reverence. Dishonest, cruel,
inquisitive, murderous, voracious, villainous, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg_105]</a></span>
some of the epithets applied to this bird of exquisite plumage.
Emerson, however, has said in his defence he does "more good than
harm," alluding, no doubt, to his habit of burying nuts and hard seeds
in the ground, so that many a waste place is clothed with trees and
shrubs, thanks to his propensity and industry.</p>

<p>He is mischievous as a small boy, destructive as a monkey, deft at
hiding as a squirrel. He is unsociable and unamiable, disliking the
society of other birds. His harsh screams, shrieks, and most
aggressive and unmusical calls seem often intended maliciously to
drown the songs of the sweet-voiced singers.</p>

<p>From April to September, the breeding and moulting season, the blue
jays are almost silent, only sallying forth from the woods to pillage
and devour the young and eggs of their more peaceful neighbors. In a
bulky nest, usually placed in a tree-crotch high above our heads, from
four to six eggs, olive-gray with brown spots, are laid and most
carefully tended.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the unlovely characteristics of the blue jay, we could
ill spare the flash of color, like a bit of blue sky dropped from
above, which is so rare a tint even in our land, that we number not
more than three or four true blue birds, and in England, it is said,
there is none.</p>

and bluish.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Female</i>&mdash;Grayish brown above, sometimes with bluish tinge on
head, lower back, and shoulders. Wings dark olive-brown, with
faint buff markings; tail same shade as wings, but with
bluish-gray markings. Underneath brownish cream-color, the
breast feathers often blue at the base.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Range</i>&mdash;United States, from southern New England westward to
the Rocky Mountains and southward into Mexico and beyond. Most
common in the Southwest. Rare along the Atlantic seaboard.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;May. September. Summer resident.</div>

<p>This beautiful but rather shy and solitary bird occasionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg_106]</a></span>
wanders eastward to rival the bluebird and the indigo bunting in their rare
and lovely coloring, and eclipse them both in song. Audubon, we
remember, found the nest in New Jersey. Pennsylvania is still favored
with one now and then, but it is in the Southwest only that the blue
grosbeak is as common as the evening grosbeak is in the Northwest.
Since rice is its favorite food, it naturally abounds where that
cereal grows. Seeds and kernels of the hardest kinds, that its heavy,
strong beak is well adapted to crack, constitute its diet when it
strays beyond the rice-fields.</p>

<p>Possibly the heavy bills of all the grosbeaks make them look stupid
whether they are or not&mdash;a characteristic that the blue grosbeak's
habit of sitting motionless with a vacant stare many minutes at a time
unfortunately emphasizes.</p>

<p>When seen in the roadside thickets or tall weeds, such as the field
sparrow chooses to frequent, it shows little fear of man unless
actually approached and threatened, but whether this fearlessness
comes from actual confidence or stupidity is by no means certain.
Whatever the motive of its inactivity, it accomplishes an end to be
desired by the cleverest bird; its presence is almost never suspected
by the passer-by, and its grassy nest on a tree-branch, containing
three or four pale bluish-white eggs, is never betrayed by look or
sign to the marauding small boy.</p>

<p>Any one who attempts to describe the coloring of a bird's plumage
knows how inadequate words are to convey a just idea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg_107]</a></span>
of the delicacy, richness, and brilliancy of the living tints. But,
happily, the beautiful barn swallow is too familiar to need
description. Wheeling about our barns and houses, skimming over the
fields, its bright sides flashing in the sunlight, playing "cross tag"
with its friends at evening, when the insects, too, are on the wing,
gyrating, darting, and gliding through the air, it is no more possible
to adequately describe the exquisite grace of a swallow's flight than
the glistening buff of its breast.</p>

<p>This is a typical bird of the air, as an oriole is of the trees and a
sparrow of the ground. Though the swallow may often be seen perching
on a telegraph wire, suddenly it darts off as if it had received a
shock of electricity, and we see the bird in its true element.</p>

<p>While this swallow is peculiarly American, it is often confounded with
its European cousin <i>Hirundo rustica</i> in noted ornithologies.</p>

<p>Up in the rafters of the barn, or in the arch of an old bridge that
spans a stream, these swallows build their bracket-like nests of clay
or mud pellets intermixed with straw. Here the noisy little broods
pick their way out of the white eggs curiously spotted with brown and
lilac that were all too familiar in the marauding days of our
childhood.</p>

<p>Not quite so brilliantly colored as the barn swallow, nor with tail so
deeply forked, and consequently without so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg_108]</a></span>
grace in flying, and with a squeak rather than the really musical
twitter of the gayer bird, the cliff swallow may be positively
identified by the rufous feathers of its tail coverts, but more
definitely by its crescent-shaped frontlet shining like a new moon;
hence its specific Latin name from <i>luna</i> = moon, and <i>frons</i> = front.</p>

<p>Such great numbers of these swallows have been seen in the far West
that the name of Rocky Mountain swallows is sometimes given to them;
though however rare they may have been in 1824, when DeWitt Clinton
thought he "discovered" them near Lake Champlain, they are now common
enough in all parts of the United States.</p>

<p>In the West this swallow is wholly a cliff-dweller, but it has learned
to modify its home in different localities. As usually seen, it is
gourd-shaped, opened at the top, built entirely of mud pellets
("bricks without straw"), softly lined with feathers and wisps of
grass, and attached by the larger part to a projecting cliff or eave.</p>

<p>Like all the swallows, this bird lives in colonies, and the
clay-colored nests beneath the eaves of barns are often so close
together that a group of them resembles nothing so much as a gigantic
wasp's nest. It is said that when swallows pair they are mated for
life; but, then, more is said about swallows than the most tireless
bird-lover could substantiate. The tradition that swallows fly low
when it is going to rain may be easily credited, because the air
before a storm is usually too heavy with moisture for the winged
insects, upon which the swallows feed, to fly high.</p>

<p>The beautiful, soft-colored plumage of this incessant and rather
melancholy love-maker is not on public exhibition. To see it we must
trace the <i>a-coo-o, coo-o, coo-oo, coo-o</i> to its source in the thick
foliage in some tree in an out-of-the-way corner of the farm, or to an
evergreen near the edge of the woods. The slow, plaintive notes, more
like a dirge than a love-song, penetrate to a surprising distance.
They may not always be the same lovers we hear from April to the end
of summer, but surely the sound seems to indicate that they are. The
dove is a shy bird, attached to its gentle and refined mate with a
devotion that has passed into a proverb, but caring little or nothing
for the society of other feathered friends, and very little for its
own kind, unless after the nesting season has passed. In this respect
it differs widely from its cousins, the wild pigeons, flocks of which,
numbering many millions, are recorded by Wilson and other early
writers before the days when netting these birds became so fatally
profitable.</p>

<p>What the dove finds to adore so ardently in the "shiftless housewife,"
as Mrs. Wright calls his lady-love, must pass the comprehension of the
ph&#339;be, that constructs such an exquisite home, or of a bustling,
energetic Jenny wren, that "looketh well to the ways of her household
and eateth not the bread of idleness." She is a flabby, spineless
bundle of flesh and pretty feathers, gentle and refined in manners,
but slack and incompetent in all she does. Her nest consists of a few
loose sticks, without rim or lining; and when her two babies emerge
from the white eggs, that somehow do not fall through or roll out of
the rickety lattice, their tender little naked bodies must suffer from
many bruises. We are almost inclined to blame the inconsiderate mother
for allowing her offspring to enter the world unclothed&mdash;obviously not
her fault, though she is capable of just such negligence. Fortunate
are the baby doves when their lazy mother scatters her makeshift nest
on top of one that a robin has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg_110]</a></span>
deserted, as she frequently does. It is almost excusable to take her
young birds and rear them in captivity, where they invariably thrive,
mate, and live happily, unless death comes to one, when the other
often refuses food and grieves its life away.</p>

<p>In the wild state, when the nesting season approaches, both birds make
curious acrobatic flights above the tree-tops; then, after a short
sail in midair, they return to their perch. This appears to be their
only giddiness and frivolity, unless a dust-bath in the country road
might be considered a dissipation.</p>

<p>In the autumn a few pairs of doves show slight gregarious tendencies,
feeding amiably together in the grain fields and retiring to the same
roost at sundown.</p>

<p>In thick woodlands, where a stream that lazily creeps through the
mossy, oozy ground attracts myriads of insects to its humid
neighborhood, this tiny hunter loves to hide in the denser foliage of
the upper branches. He has the habit of nervously flitting about from
twig to twig of his relatives, the kinglets, but unhappily he lacks
their social, friendly instincts, and therefore is rarely seen.
Formerly classed among the warblers, then among the flycatchers, while
still as much a lover of flies, gnats, and mosquitoes as ever, his
vocal powers have now won for him recognition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg_111]</a></span>
among the singing birds. Some one has likened his voice to the squeak
of a mouse, and Nuttall says it is "scarcely louder," which is all
too true, for at a little distance it is quite inaudible. But in
addition to the mouse-like call-note, the tiny bird has a rather
feeble but exquisitely finished song, so faint it seems almost as if
the bird were singing in its sleep.</p>

<p>If by accident you enter the neighborhood of its nest, you soon find
out that this timid, soft-voiced little creature can be roused to
rashness and make its presence disagreeable to ears and eyes alike as
it angrily darts about your unoffending head, pecking at your face and
uttering its shrill squeak close to your very ear-drums. All this
excitement is in defence of a dainty, lichen-covered nest, whose
presence you may not have even suspected before, and of four or five
bluish-white, speckled eggs well beyond reach in the tree-tops.</p>

<p>During the migrations the bird seems not unwilling to show its
delicate, trim little body, that has often been likened to a
diminutive mocking-bird's, very near the homes of men. Its graceful
postures, its song and constant motion, are sure to attract attention.
In Central Park, New York City, the bird is not unknown.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Male and Female</i>&mdash;Upper parts cinnamon-brown. Deepest shade

in the United States, from the Mississippi eastward. Winters

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;April. October. Common summer resident.</div>

<p>Early some morning in April there will go off under your window that
most delightful of all alarm-clocks&mdash;the tiny, friendly house wren,
just returned from a long visit south. Like some little mountain
spring that, having been imprisoned by winter ice, now bubbles up in
the spring sunshine, and goes rippling along over the pebbles,
tumbling over itself in merry cascades, so this little wren's song
bubbles, ripples, cascades in a miniature torrent of ecstasy.</p>

<p>Year after year these birds return to the same nesting places: a box
set up against the house, a crevice in the barn, a niche under the
eaves; but once home, always home to them. The nest is kept
scrupulously clean; the house-cleaning, like the house-building and
renovating, being accompanied by the cheeriest of songs, that makes
the bird fairly tremble by its intensity. But however angelic the
voice of the house wren, its temper can put to flight even the English
sparrow. Need description go further?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg_116]</a></span>
Six to eight minutely speckled, flesh-colored eggs suffice to keep the
nervous, irritable parents in a state bordering on frenzy whenever
another bird comes near their habitation. With tail erect and head
alert, the father mounts on guard, singing a perfect ecstasy of love
to his silent little mate, that sits upon the nest if no danger
threatens; but both rush with passionate malice upon the first
intruder, for it must be admitted that Jenny wren is a sad shrew.</p>

<p>While the little family is being reared, or, indeed, at any time, no
one is wise enough to estimate the millions of tiny insects from the
garden that find their way into the tireless bills of these wrens.</p>

<p>It is often said that the house wren remains at the north all the
year, which, though not a fact, is easily accounted for by the coming
of the winter wrens just as the others migrate in the autumn, and by
their return to Canada when Jenny wren makes up her feather-bed under
the eaves in the spring.</p>

<div class="caption3"><i>Called also</i>: MOCKING WREN</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Length</i>&mdash;6 inches. Just a trifle smaller than the English sparrow.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Male and Female</i>&mdash;Chestnut-brown above. A whitish streak,
beginning at base of bill, passes through the eye to the nape
of the neck. Throat whitish. Under parts light buff-brown.
Wings and tail finely barred with dark.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Range</i>&mdash;United States, from Gulf to northern Illinois and
southern New England.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;A common resident except at northern boundary of
range, where it is a summer visitor.</div>

<p>This largest of the wrens appears to be the embodiment of the entire
family characteristics: it is exceedingly active, nervous, and easily
excited, quick-tempered, full of curiosity, peeping into every hole
and corner it passes, short of flight as it is of wing, inseparable
from its mate till parted by death, and a gushing lyrical songster
that only death itself can silence. It also has the wren-like
preference for a nest that is roofed over, but not too near the homes
of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg_117]</a></span>
Undergrowths near water, brush heaps, rocky bits of woodland, are
favorite resorts. The Carolina wren decidedly objects to being stared
at, and likes to dart out of sight in the midst of the underbrush in a
twinkling while the opera-glasses are being focussed.</p>

<p>To let off some of his superfluous vivacity, Nature has provided him
with two safety-valves: one is his voice, another is his tail. With
the latter he gesticulates in a manner so expressive that it seems to
be a certain index to what is passing in his busy little
brain&mdash;drooping it, after the habit of the catbird, when he becomes
limp with the emotion of his love-song, or holding it erect as, alert
and inquisitive, he peers at the impudent intruder in the thicket
below his perch.</p>

<p>But it is his joyous, melodious, bubbling song that is his chief
fascination. He has so great a variety of strains that many people
have thought that he learned them from other birds, and so have called
him what many ornithologists declare that he is not&mdash;a mocking wren.
And he is one of the few birds that sing at night&mdash;not in his sleep or
only by moonlight, but even in the total darkness, just before dawn,
he gives us the same wide-awake song that entrances us by day.</p>

(<i>Troglodytes hiemalis</i>) Wren family</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Length</i>&mdash;4 to 4.5 inches. About one-third smaller than the
English sparrow. Apparently only half the size.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Male and Female</i>&mdash;Cinnamon-brown above, with numerous short,
dusky bars. Head and neck without markings. Underneath rusty,
dimly and finely barred with dark brown. Tail short.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Range</i>&mdash;United States, east and west, and from North Carolina
to the Fur Countries.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;October, April. Summer resident. Commonly a
winter resident in the South and Middle States only.</div>

<p>It all too rarely happens that we see this tiny mouse-like wren in
summer, unless we come upon him suddenly and overtake him unawares as
he creeps shyly over the mossy logs or runs literally "like a flash"
under the fern and through the tangled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg_118]</a></span>
underbrush of the deep, cool woods. His presence there is far more
likely to be detected by the ear than the eye.</p>

<p>Throughout the nesting season music fairly pours from his tiny throat;
it bubbles up like champagne; it gushes forth in a lyrical torrent and
overflows into every nook of the forest, that seems entirely pervaded
by his song. While music is everywhere, it apparently comes from no
particular point, and, search as you may, the tiny singer still
eludes, exasperates, and yet entrances.</p>

<p>If by accident you discover him balancing on a swaying twig, never far
from the ground, with his comical little tail erect, or more likely
pointing towards his head, what a pert, saucy minstrel he is! You are
lost in amazement that so much music could come from a throat so tiny.</p>

<p>Comparatively few of his admirers, however, hear the exquisite notes
of this little brown wood-sprite, for after the nesting season is over
he finds little to call them forth during the bleak, snowy winter
months, when in the Middle and Southern States he may properly be
called a neighbor. Sharp hunger, rather than natural boldness, drives
him near the homes of men, where he appears just as the house wren
departs for the South. With a forced confidence in man that is almost
pathetic in a bird that loves the forest as he does, he picks up
whatever lies about the house or barn in the shape of food&mdash;crumbs
from the kitchen door, a morsel from the dog's plate, a little seed in
the barn-yard, happily rewarded if he can find a spider lurking in
some sheltered place to give a flavor to the unrelished grain. Now he
becomes almost tame, but we feel it is only because he must be.</p>

<p>The spot that decided preference leads him to, either winter or
summer, is beside a bubbling spring. In the moss that grows near it
the nest is placed in early summer, nearly always roofed over and
entered from the side, in true wren-fashion; and as the young
fledglings emerge from the creamy-white eggs, almost the first lesson
they receive from their devoted little parents is in the fine art of
bathing. Even in winter weather, when the wren has to stand on a rim
of ice, he will duck and splash his diminutive body. It is recorded of
a certain little individual that he was wont to dive through the icy
water on a December day. Evidently the wrens, as a family, are not far
removed in the evolutionary scale from true water-birds.</p>

<div class="caption2">Long-billed Marsh Wren<br />

(<i>Cistothorus palustris</i>) Wren family</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Length</i>&mdash;4.5 to 5.2 inches. Actually a little smaller than
the English sparrow. Apparently half the size.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Male and Female</i>&mdash;Brown above, with white line over the eye,
and the back irregularly and faintly streaked with white.
Wings and tail barred with darker cinnamon-brown. Underneath
white. Sides dusky. Tail long and often carried erect. Bill

<p>Sometimes when you are gathering cat-tails in the river marshes an
alert, nervous little brown bird rises startled from the rushes and
tries to elude you as with short, jerky flight it goes deeper and
deeper into the marsh, where even the rubber boot may not follow. It
closely resembles two other birds found in such a place, the swamp
sparrow and the short-billed marsh wren; but you may know by its long,
slender bill that it is not the latter, and by the absence of a bright
bay crown that it is not the shyest of the sparrows.</p>

<p>These marsh wrens appear to be especially partial to running water;
their homes are not very far from brooks and rivers, preferably those
that are affected in their rise and flow by the tides. They build in
colonies, and might be called inveterate singers, for no single bird
is often permitted to finish his bubbling song without half the colony
joining in a chorus.</p>

<p>Still another characteristic of this particularly interesting bird is
its unique architectural effects produced with coarse grasses woven
into globular form and suspended in the reeds. Sometimes adapting its
nest to the building material at hand, it weaves it of grasses and
twigs, and suspends it from the limb of a bush or tree overhanging the
water, where it swings like an oriole's. The entrance to the nest is
invariably on the side.</p>

<p>More devoted homebodies than these little wrens are not among the
feathered tribe. Once let the hand of man desecrate their nest, even
before the tiny speckled eggs are deposited in it, and off go the
birds to a more inaccessible place, where they can enjoy their home
unmolested. Thus three or four nests may be made in a summer.</p>

(<i>Cistothorus stellaris</i>) Wren family</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Length</i>&mdash;4 to 5 inches. Actually about one-third smaller than
the English sparrow, but apparently only half its size.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Male and Female</i>&mdash;Brown above, faintly streaked with white, black,
and buff. Wings and tail barred with same. Underneath white, with
buff and rusty tinges on throat and breast. Short bill.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Range</i>&mdash;North America, from Manitoba southward in winter to
Gulf of Mexico. Most common in north temperate latitudes.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;Early May. Late September.</div>

<p>Where red-winged blackbirds like to congregate in oozy pastures or
near boggy woods, the little short-billed wren may more often be heard
than seen, for he is more shy, if possible, than his long-billed
cousin, and will dive down into the sedges at your approach, very much
as a duck disappears under water. But if you see him at all, it is
usually while swaying to and fro as he clings to some tall stalk of
grass, keeping his balance by the nervous, jerky tail motions
characteristic of all the wrens, and singing with all his might.
Oftentimes his tail reaches backward almost to his head in a most
exaggerated wren-fashion.</p>

<p>Samuels explains the peculiar habit both the long-billed and the
short-billed marsh wrens have of building several nests in one season,
by the theory that they are made to protect the sitting female, for it
is noticed that the male bird always lures a visitor to an empty nest,
and if this does not satisfy his curiosity, to another one, to prove
conclusively that he has no family in prospect.</p>

<p>Wild rice is an ideal nesting place for a colony of these little marsh
wrens. The home is made of sedge grasses, softly lined with the softer
meadow grass or plant-down, and placed in a tussock of tall grass, or
even upon the ground. The entrance is on the side. But while fond of
moist places, both for a home and feeding ground, it will be noticed
that these wrens have no special fondness for running water, so dear
to their long-billed relatives. Another distinction is that the eggs
of this species, instead of being so densely speckled as to look
brown, are pure white.</p>

<span class="i2">"There's a merry brown thrush sitting up in a tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&nbsp;&nbsp;He is singing to me! He is singing to me!<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The hackneyed poem beginning with this stanza that delighted our
nursery days, has left in our minds a fairly correct impression of the
bird. He still proves to be one of the perennially joyous singers,
like a true cousin of the wrens, and when we study him afield, he
appears to give his whole attention to his song with a
self-consciousness that is rather amusing than the reverse. "What
musician wouldn't be conscious of his own powers," he seems to
challenge us, "if he possessed such a gift?" Seated on a conspicuous
perch, as if inviting attention to his performance, with uplifted head
and drooping tail he repeats the one exultant, dashing air to which
his repertoire is limited, without waiting for an encore. Much
practice has given the notes a brilliancy of execution to be compared
only with the mocking-bird's; but in spite of the name "ferruginous
mocking-bird" that Audubon gave him, he does not seem to have the
faculty of imitating other birds' songs. Thoreau says the
Massachusetts farmers, when planting their seed, always think they
hear the thrasher say, "Drop it, drop it&mdash;cover it up, cover it
up&mdash;pull it up, pull it up, pull it up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg_122]</a></span>
One of the shatterings of childish impressions that age too often
brings is when we learn by the books that our "merry brown thrush" is
no thrush at all, but a thrasher&mdash;first cousin to the wrens, in spite
of his speckled breast, large size, and certain thrush-like instincts,
such as never singing near the nest and shunning mankind in the
nesting season, to mention only two. Certainly his bold, swinging
flight and habit of hopping and running over the ground would seem to
indicate that he is not very far removed from the true thrushes. But
he has one undeniable wren-like trait, that of twitching, wagging, and
thrashing his long tail about to help express his emotions. It swings
like a pendulum as he rests on a branch, and thrashes about in a most
ludicrous way as he is feeding on the ground upon the worms, insects,
and fruit that constitute his diet.</p>

<p>Before the fatal multiplication of cats, and in unfrequented, sandy
locations still, the thrasher builds her nest upon the ground, thus
earning the name "ground thrush" that is often given her; but with
dearly paid-for wisdom she now most frequently selects a low shrub or
tree to cradle the two broods that all too early in the summer
effectually silence the father's delightful song.</p>

<p>To many of us the veery, as they call the Wilson's thrush in New
England, is merely a voice, a sylvan mystery, reflecting the sweetness
and wildness of the forest, a vocal "will-o'-the-wisp" that, after
enticing us deeper and deeper into the woods, where we sink into the
spongy moss of its damp retreats and become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg_123]</a></span>
entangled in the wild grapevines twined about the saplings and
underbrush, still sings to us from unapproachable tangles. Plainly,
if we want to see the bird, we must let it seek us out on the fallen
log where we have sunk exhausted in the chase.</p>

<p>Presently a brown bird scuds through the fern. It is a thrush, you
guess in a minute, from its slender, graceful body. At first you
notice no speckles on its breast, but as it comes nearer, obscure
arrow-heads are visible&mdash;not heavy, heart-shaped spots such as
plentifully speckle the larger wood thrush or the smaller hermit. It
is the smallest of the three commoner thrushes, and it lacks the ring
about the eye that both the others have. Shy and elusive, it slips
away again in a most unfriendly fashion, and is lost in the wet tangle
before you have become acquainted. You determine, however, before you
leave the log, to cultivate the acquaintance of this bird the next
spring, when, before it mates and retreats to the forest, it comes
boldly into the gardens and scratches about in the dry leaves on the
ground for the lurking insects beneath. Miss Florence Merriam tells of
having drawn a number of veeries about her by imitating their
call-note, which is a whistled <i>wheew, whoit</i>, very easy to
counterfeit when once heard. "<i>Taweel-ab, taweel-ab, twil-ab,
twil-ab!</i>" Professor Ridgeway interprets their song, that descends in
a succession of trills without break or pause; but no words can
possibly convey an idea of the quality of the music. The veery, that
never claims an audience, sings at night also, and its weird, sweet
strains floating through the woods at dusk, thrill one like the
mysterious voice of a disembodied spirit.</p>

<p>When Nuttall wrote of "this solitary and retiring songster," before
the country was as thickly settled as it is to-day, it possibly had
not developed the confidence in men that now distinguishes the wood
thrush from its shy congeners that are distinctly wood birds, which it
can no longer strictly be said to be. In city parks and country
places, where plenty of trees shade the village streets and lawns, it
comes near you, half hopping, half running, with dignified
unconsciousness and even familiarity, all the more delightful in a
bird whose family instincts should take it into secluded woodlands
with their shady dells. Perhaps, in its heart of hearts, it still
prefers such retreats. Many conservative wood thrushes keep to their
wild haunts, and it must be owned not a few liberals, that discard
family traditions at other times, seek the forest at nesting time. But
social as the wood thrush is and abundant, too, it is also eminently
high-bred; and when contrasted with its tawny cousin, the veery, that
skulks away to hide in the nearest bushes as you approach, or with the
hermit thrush, that pours out its heavenly song in the solitude of the
forest, how gracious and full of gentle confidence it seems! Every
gesture is graceful and elegant; even a wriggling beetle is eaten as
daintily as caviare at the king's table. It is only when its
confidence in you is abused, and you pass too near the nest, that
might easily be mistaken for a robin's, just above your head in a
sapling, that the wood thrush so far forgets itself as to become
excited. <i>Pit, pit, pit</i>, sharply reiterated, is called out at you
with a strident quality in the tone that is painful evidence of the
fearful anxiety your presence gives this gentle bird.</p>

<p>Too many guardians of nests, whether out of excessive happiness or
excessive stupidity, have a dangerous habit of singing very near them.
Not so the wood thrush. "Come to me," as the opening notes of its
flute-like song have been freely translated, invites the intruder far
away from where the blue eggs lie cradled in ambush. "<i>Uoli-a-e-o-li-noli-nol-aeolee-lee!</i>" is as good a rendering into
syllables of the luscious song as could very well be made. Pure,
liquid, rich, and luscious, it rings out from the trees on the summer
air and penetrates our home like a strain of music from a stringed
quartette.</p>

<p>The first thrush to come and the last to go, nevertheless the hermit
is little seen throughout its long visit north. It may loiter awhile
in the shrubby roadsides, in the garden or the parks in the spring
before it begins the serious business of life in a nest of moss,
coarse grass, and pine-needles placed on the ground in the depths of
the forest, but by the middle of May its presence in the neighborhood
of our homes becomes only a memory. Although one never hears it at its
best during the migrations, how one loves to recall the serene,
ethereal evening hymn! "The finest sound in Nature," John Burroughs
calls it. "It is not a proud, gorgeous strain like the tanager's or
the grosbeak's," he says; "it suggests no passion or emotion&mdash;nothing
personal, but seems to be the voice of that calm, sweet solemnity one
attains to in his best moments. It realizes a peace and a deep, solemn
joy that only the finest souls may know."</p>

<p>Beyond the question of even the hypercritical, the hermit thrush has a
more exquisitely beautiful voice than any other American bird, and
only the nightingale's of Europe can be compared with it. It is the
one theme that exhausts all the ornithologists' musical adjectives in
a vain attempt to convey in words any idea of it to one who has never
heard it, for the quality of the song is as elusive as the bird
itself. But why should the poets be so silent? Why has it not called
forth such verse as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg_126]</a></span>
English poets have lavished upon the nightingale? Undoubtedly because
it lifts up its heavenly voice in the solitude of the forest, whereas
the nightingales, singing in loud choruses in the moonlight under the
poet's very window, cannot but impress his waking thoughts and even
his dreams with their melody.</p>

<p>Since the severe storm and cold in the Gulf States a few winters ago,
where vast numbers of hermit thrushes died from cold and starvation,
this bird has been very rare in haunts where it used to be abundant.
The other thrushes escaped because they spend the winter farther
south.</p>

<p>One looks for a prettier bird than this least attractive of all the
thrushes in one that bears such a suggestive name. Like the
olive-backed thrush, from which it is almost impossible to tell it
when both are alive and hopping about the shrubbery, its plumage above
is a dull olive-brown that is more protective than pleasing.</p>

<p>Just as Wilson hopelessly confused the olive-backed thrush with the
hermit, so has Alice's thrush been confounded by later writers with
the olive-backed, from which it differs chiefly in being a trifle
larger, in having gray cheeks instead of buff, and in possessing a few
faint streaks on the throat. Where it goes to make a home for its
greenish-blue speckled eggs in some low bush at the northern end of
its range, it bursts into song, but except in the nesting grounds its
voice is never heard. Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg_127]</a></span>
Bradford Torrey, who heard it singing in the White Mountains,
describes the song as like the thrush's in quality, but differently
accented: "<i>Wee-o-wee-o-tit-ti-wee-o!</i>"</p>

<p>In New England and New York this thrush is most often seen during its
autumn migrations. As it startsup and perches upon a low branch
before you, it appears to have longer legs and a broader, squarer tail
than its congeners.</p>

<p>Mr. Parkhurst tells of finding this "the commonest bird in the Park
(Central Park, New York), not even excepting the robin," during the
last week of May on a certain year; but usually, it must be owned, we
have to be on the lookout to find it, or it will pass unnoticed in the
great companies of more conspicuous birds travelling at the same time.
White-throated sparrows often keep it company on the long journeys
northward, and they may frequently be seen together, hopping sociably
about the garden, the thrush calling out a rather harsh note&mdash;<i>puk!
puk!</i>&mdash;quite different from the liquid, mellow calls of the other
thrushes, to resent either the sparrows' bad manners or the
inquisitiveness of a human disturber of its peace. But this gregarious
habit and neighborly visit end even before acquaintance fairly begins,
and the thrushes are off for their nesting grounds in the pine woods
of New England or Labrador if they are travelling up the east coast,
or to Alaska, British Columbia, or Manitoba if west of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg_128]</a></span>
Mississippi. There they stay all summer, often travelling southward
with the sparrows in the autumn, as in the spring.</p>

<p>Why they should prefer coniferous trees, unless to utilize the needles
for a nest, is not understood. Low trees and bushes are favorite
building sites with them as with others of the family, though these
thrushes disdain a mud lining to their nests. Those who have heard the
olive-backed thrush singing an even-song to its brooding mate compare
it with the veery's, but it has a break in it and is less simple and
pleasing than the latter's.</p>

<p>This bird, that so delighted Audubon with its high-trilled song as he
tramped with indefatigable zeal through the hammocks of the Gulf
States, seems to be almost the counterpart of the Northern water
thrush, just as the loggerhead is the Southern counterpart of the
Northern shrike. Very many Eastern birds have their duplicates in
Western species, as we all know, and it is most interesting to trace
the slight external variations that different climates and diet have
produced on the same bird, and thus differentiated the species. In
winter the Northern water thrush visits the cradle of its kind, the
swamps of Louisiana and Florida, and, no doubt, by daily contact with
its congeners there, keeps close to their cherished traditions, from
which it never deviates farther than Nature compels, though it
penetrate to the arctic regions during its summer journeys.</p>

<p>With a more southerly range, the Louisiana water thrush does not
venture beyond the White Mountains and to the shores of the Great
Lakes in summer, but even at the North the same woods often contain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg_129]</a></span>
both birds, and there is opportunity to note just how much they
differ. The Southern bird is slightly the larger, possibly an inch; it
is more gray, and it lacks a few of the streaks, notably on the
throat, that plentifully speckle its Northern counterpart; but the
habits of both of these birds appear to be identical. Only for a few
days in the spring or autumn migrations do they pass near enough to
our homes for us to study them, and then we must ever be on the alert
to steal a glance at them through the opera-glasses, for birds more
shy than they do not visit the garden shrubbery at any season. Only
let them suspect they are being stared at, and they are under cover in
a twinkling.</p>

<p>Where mountain streams dash through tracts of mossy, spongy ground
that is carpeted with fern and moss, and overgrown with impenetrable
thickets of underbrush and tangles of creepers&mdash;such a place is the
favorite resort of both the water thrushes. With a rubber boot
missing, clothes torn, and temper by no means unruffled, you finally
stand over the Louisiana thrush's nest in the roots of an upturned
tree immediately over the water, or else in a mossy root-belaced bank
above a purling stream. A liquid-trilled warble, wild and sweet,
breaks the stillness, and, like Audubon, you feel amply rewarded for
your pains though you may not be prepared to agree with him in
thinking the song the equal of the European nightingale's.</p>

According to the books we have before us, a warbler; but who, to look
at his speckled throat and breast, would ever take him for anything
but a diminutive thrush; or, studying him from some distance through
the opera-glasses as he runs in and out of the little waves along the
brook or river shore, would not name him a baby sandpiper? The rather
unsteady motion of his legs, balancing of the tail, and sudden jerking
of the head suggest an aquatic bird rather than a bird of the woods.
But to really know either man or beast, you must follow him to his
home, and if you have pluck enough to brave the swamp and the almost
impenetrable tangle of undergrowth where the water thrush chooses to
nest, there "In the swamp in secluded recesses, a shy and hidden bird
is warbling a song;" and this warbled song that Walt Whitman so adored
gives you your first clue to the proper classification of the bird. It
has nothing in common with the serene, hymn-like voices of the true
thrushes; the bird has no flute-like notes, but an emphatic smacking
or chucking kind of warble. For a few days only is this song heard
about the gardens and roadsides of our country places. Like the
Louisiana water thrush, this bird never ventures near the homes of men
after the spring and autumn migrations, but, on the contrary, goes as
far away from them as possible, preferably to some mountain region,
beside a cool and dashing brook, where a party of adventurous young
climbers from a summer hotel or the lonely trout fisherman may startle
it from its mossy nest on the ground.</p>

<p>If we were to follow the list of thirty-six aliases by which this
largest and commonest of our woodpeckers is known throughout its wide
range, we should find all its peculiarities of color, flight, noises,
and habits indicated in its popular names. It cannot but attract
attention wherever seen, with its beautiful plumage, conspicuously
yellow if its outstretched wings are looked at from below,
conspicuously brown and white if seen upon the ground. At a distance
it suggests the meadowlark. Both birds wear black, crescent breast
decorations, and the flicker also has the habit of feeding upon the
ground, especially in autumn, a characteristic not shared by its
relations.</p>

<p>Early in the spring this bird of many names and many voices makes
itself known by a long, strong, sonorous call, a sort of proclamation
that differs from its song proper, which Audubon calls "a prolonged
jovial laugh" (described by Mrs. Wright as "<i>Wick, wick, wick,
wick!</i>"), and differs also from its rapidly repeated, mellow, and most
musical <i>cuh, cuh, cuh, cuh, cuh</i>, uttered during the nesting season.</p>

<p>Its nasal <i>kee-yer</i>, vigorously called out in the autumn, is less
characteristic, however, than the sound it makes while associating
with its fellows on the feeding ground&mdash;a sound that Mr. Frank M.
Chapman says can be closely imitated by the swishing of a willow wand.</p>

<p>A very ardent and ridiculous-looking lover is this bird, as, with tail
stiffly spread, he sidles up to his desired mate and bows and bobs
before her, then retreats and advances, bowing and bobbing again, very
often with a rival lover beside him (whom he generously tolerates)
trying to outdo him in grace and general attractiveness. Not the least
of the bird's qualities that must commend themselves to the bride is
his unfailing good nature, genial alike in the home and in the field.</p>

<p>The "high-holders" have the peculiar and silly habit of boring out a
number of superfluous holes for nests high up in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg_132]</a></span>
trees, in buildings, or hollow wooden columns, only one of which they
intend to use. Six white eggs is the proper number for a household,
but Dr. Coues says the female that has been robbed keeps on laying
three or even four sets of eggs without interruption.</p>

<p>In the same meadows with the red-winged blackbirds, birds of another
feather, but of the same family, nevertheless, may be found flocking
together, hunting for worms and larv&#230;, building their nests, and
rearing their young very near each other with the truly social
instinct of all their kin.</p>

<p>The meadowlarks, which are really not larks at all, but the
blackbirds' and orioles' cousins, are so protected by the coloring of
the feathers on their backs, like that of the grass and stubble they
live among, that ten blackbirds are noticed for every meadowlark,
although the latter is very common. Not until you flush a flock of
them as you walk along the roadside or through the meadows and you
note the white tail feathers and the black crescents on the yellow
breasts of the large brown birds that rise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg_133]</a></span>
towards the tree-tops with whirring sound and a flight suggesting the
quail's, do you suspect there are any birds among the tall grasses.</p>

<p>Their clear and piercing whistle, "<i>Spring o' the y-e-a-r, Spring o'
the year!</i>" rings out from the trees with varying intonation and
accent, but always sweet and inspiriting. To the bird's high vantage
ground you may not follow, for no longer having the protection of the
high grass, it has become wary and flies away as you approach, calling
out <i>peent-peent</i> and nervously flitting its tail (again showing the
white feather), when it rests a moment on the pasture fence-rail.</p>

<p>It is like looking for a needle in a haystack to try to find a
meadowlark's nest, an unpretentious structure of dried grasses partly
arched over and hidden in a clump of high timothy, flat upon the
ground. But what havoc snakes and field-mice play with the
white-speckled eggs and helpless fledglings! The care of rearing two
or three broods in a season and the change of plumage to duller winter
tints seem to exhaust the high spirits of the sweet whistler. For a
time he is silent, but partly regains his vocal powers in the autumn,
when, with large flocks of his own kind, he resorts to marshy feeding
grounds. In the winter he chooses for companions the horned larks,
that walk along the shore, or the snow buntings and sparrows of the
inland pastures, and will even include the denizens of the barn-yard
when hunger drives him close to the haunts of men.</p>

this meadowlark: "In richness of voice and modulation it equals or

articulation it has no superior in the whole world of feathered

<p>Far away to the north in Greenland and Labrador this true lark, the
most beautiful of its genus, makes its summer home. There it is a
conspicuously handsome bird with its pinkish-gray and chocolate
feathers, that have greatly faded into dull browns when we see them in
the late autumn. In the far north only does it sing, and, according to
Audubon, the charming song is flung to the breeze while the bird soars
like a skylark. In the United States we hear only its call-note.</p>

<p>Great flocks come down the Atlantic coast in October and November, and
separate into smaller bands that take up their residence in sandy
stretches and open tracts near the sea or wherever the food supply
looks promising, and there the larks stay until all the seeds, buds of
bushes, berries, larv&#230;, and insects in their chosen territory are
exhausted. They are ever conspicuously ground birds, walkers, and when
disturbed at their dinner, prefer to squat on the earth rather than
expose themselves by flight. Sometimes they run nimbly over the frozen
ground to escape an intruder, but flying they reserve as a last
resort. When the visitor has passed they quickly return to their
dinner. If they were content to eat less ravenously and remain
slender, fewer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg_135]</a></span>
victims might be slaughtered annually to tickle the palates of the
epicure. It is a mystery what they find to fatten upon when snow
covers the frozen ground. Even in the severe midwinter storms they
will not seek the protection of the woods, but always prefer sandy
dunes with their scrubby undergrowth or open meadow lands.
Occasionally a small flock wanders toward the farms to pick up seeds
that are blown from the hayricks or scattered about the barn-yard by
overfed domestic fowls.</p>

more southerly range, confined to northern portions of the United
States from the Mississippi eastward. Once a distinctly prairie bird,
it now roams wherever large stretches of open country that suit its
purposes are cleared in the East, and remains resident. This species
also sings in midair on the wing, but its song is a crude,
half-inarticulate affair, barely audible from a height of two hundred
feet.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg_136]</a></span>
reddish tinge; but at any season, and under all circumstances, the
pipit is a distinctly brown bird, resembling the water thrushes not in
plumage only, but in the comical tail waggings and jerkings that alone
are sufficient to identify it. However the books may tell us the bird
is a wagtail, it certainly possesses two strong characteristics of
true larks: it is a walker, delighting in walking or running, never
hopping over the ground, and it has the angelic habit of singing as it
flies.</p>

<p>During the migrations the pipits are abundant in salt marshes or open
stretches of country inland, that, with lark-like preference, they
choose for feeding grounds. When flushed, all the flock rise together
with uncertain flight, hovering and wheeling about the place, calling
down <i>dee-dee</i>, <i>dee-dee</i> above your head until you have passed on
your way, then promptly returning to the spot from whence they were
disturbed. Along the roadsides and pastures, where two or three birds
are frequently seen together, they are too often mistaken for the
vesper sparrows because of their similar size and coloring, but their
easy, graceful walk should distinguish them at once from the hopping
sparrow. They often run to get ahead of some one in the lane, but
rarely fly if they can help it, and then scarcely higher than a
fence-rail. Early in summer they are off for the mountains in the
north. Labrador is their chosen nesting ground, and they are said to
place their grassy nest, lined with lichens or moss, flat upon the
ground&mdash;still another lark trait. Their eggs are chocolate-brown
scratched with black.</p>

The whippoorwill, because of its nocturnal habits and plaintive note,
is invested with a reputation for occult power which inspires a
chilling awe among superstitious people, and leads them insanely to
attribute to it an evil influence; but it is a harmless, useful night
prowler, flying low and catching enormous numbers of hurtful insects,
always the winged varieties, in its peculiar fly-trap mouth.</p>

<p>It loves the rocky, solitary woods, where it sleeps all day; but it is
seldom seen, even after painstaking search, because of its dull,
mottled markings conforming so nearly to rocks and dry leaves, and
because of its unusual habit of stretching itself lengthwise on a tree
branch or ledge, where it is easily confounded with a patch of lichen,
and thus overlooked. If by accident one happens upon a sleeping bird,
it suddenly rouses and flies away, making no more sound than a passing
butterfly&mdash;a curious and uncanny silence that is quite remarkable.
When the sun goes down and as the gloaming deepens, the bird's
activity increases, and it begins its nightly duties, emitting from
time to time, like a sentry on his post or a watchman of the night,
the doleful call which has given the bird its common name. It</p>

<span class="i2">"Mourns unseen, and ceaseless sings<br /></span>

<div class="justify">that our Dutch ancestors interpreted as "<i>Quote-kerr-kee</i>" and so
called it. They had a tradition that no frost ever appeared after the
bird had been heard calling in the spring, and that it wisely left for
warmer skies before frost came in the autumn. Prudent bird, never
caught napping!</div>

<p>It is erratic in its choice of habitations, even when rock and
solitude seem suited to its taste. Very rarely is this odd bird found
close to the seashore, and in the Hudson River valley it keeps a half
mile or more back from the river.</p>

<p>The eggs, generally two in number, are creamy white, dashed with dark
and olive spots, and laid on the ground on dry leaves, or in a little
hollow in rock or stump&mdash;never in a nest built with loving care. But
in extenuation of such carelessness it may be said that, if disturbed
or threatened, the mother shows no lack of maternal instinct, and
removes her young, carrying them in her beak as a cat conveys her
kittens to secure shelter.</p>

<p>The nighthawk's misleading name could not well imply more that the
bird is not: it is not nocturnal in its habits, neither is it a hawk,
for if it were, no account of it would be given in this book, which
distinctly excludes birds of prey. Stories of its chicken-stealing
prove to be ignorant rather than malicious slanders. Any one disliking
the name, however, surely cannot complain of a limited choice of other
names by which, in different sections of the country, it is quite as
commonly known.</p>

<p>Too often it is mistaken for the whippoorwill. The nighthawk does not
have the weird and woful cry of that more dismal bird, but gives
instead a harsh, whistling note while on the wing, followed by a
vibrating, booming, whirring sound that Nuttall likens to "the rapid
turning of a spinning wheel, or a strong blowing into the bung-hole of
an empty hogshead." This peculiar sound is responsible for the name
nightjar, frequently given to this curious bird. It is said to be made
as the bird drops suddenly through the air, creating a sort of
stringed instrument of its outstretched wings and tail. When these
wings are spread, their large white spots running through the feathers
to the under side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg_139]</a></span>
should be noted to further distinguish the nighthawk from the
whippoorwill, which has none, but which it otherwise closely
resembles. This booming sound, coming from such a height that the bird
itself is often unseen, was said by the Indians to be made by the shad
spirits to warn the scholes of shad about to ascend the rivers to
spawn in the spring, of their impending fate.</p>

<p>The flight of the nighthawk is free and graceful in the extreme.
Soaring through space without any apparent motion of its wings,
suddenly it darts with amazing swiftness like an erratic bat after the
fly, mosquito, beetle, or moth that falls within the range of its
truly hawk-like eye.</p>

<p>Usually the nighthawks hunt in little companies in the most sociable
fashion. Late in the summer they seem to be almost gregarious. They
fly in the early morning or late afternoon with beak wide open,
hawking for insects, but except when the moon is full they are not
known to go a-hunting after sunset. During the heat of the day and at
night they rest on limbs of trees, fence-rails, stone walls,
lichen-covered rocks or old logs&mdash;wherever Nature has provided
suitable mimicry of their plumage to help conceal them.</p>

<p>With this object in mind, they quite as often choose a hollow surface
of rock in some waste pasture or the open ground on which to deposit
the two speckled-gray eggs that sixteen days later will give birth to
their family. But in August, when family cares have ended for the
season, it is curious to find this bird of the thickly wooded country
readily adapting itself to city life, resting on Mansard roofs,
darting into the streets from the house-tops, and wheeling about the
electric lights, making a hearty supper of the little, winged insects
they attract.</p>

</div></div>

<p>From the tangled shrubbery on the hillside back of Dove Cottage,
Keswick, where Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy listened for the
coming of this "darling of the spring"; in the willows overhanging
Shakespeare's Avon; from the favorite haunts of Chaucer and Spenser,
where</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Runneth meade and springeth blede,"</span>

<div class="justify">hear the cuckoo calling; but how many on this side of the Atlantic
are familiar with its American counterpart? Here, too, the cuckoo
delights in running water and damp, cloudy weather like that of an
English spring; it haunts the willows by our river-sides, where as yet
no "immortal bard" arises to give it fame. It "loud sings" in our
shrubbery, too. Indeed, if we cannot study our bird afield, the next
best place to become acquainted with it is in the pages of the English
poets. But due allowance must be made for differences of temperament.
Our cuckoo is scarcely a "merry harbinger"; his talents, such as they
are, certainly are not musical. However, the guttural cluck is not
discordant, and the black-billed species, at least, has a soft, mellow
voice that seems to indicate an embryonic songster. "<i>K-k-k-k,
kow-kow-ow-kow-ow!</i>" is a familiar sound in many localities, but the
large, slim, pigeon-shaped, brownish-olive bird that makes it,
securely hidden in the low trees and shrubs that are its haunts, is
not often personally known. Catching a glimpse only of the
grayish-white under parts from where we stand looking up into the tree
at it, it is quite impossible to tell the bird from the yellow-billed
species. When, as it flies about, we are able to note the red circles
about its eyes, its black bill, and the absence of black tail
feathers, with their white "thumb-nail" spots, and see no bright
cinnamon feathers on the wings (the yellow-billed specie's
distinguishing marks), we can at last claim acquaintance with the
black-billed cuckoo. Our two common cuckoos are so nearly alike that
they are constantly confused in the popular mind and very often in the
writings of ornithologists. At first glance the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg_141]</a></span>
birds look alike. Their haunts are almost identical; their habits are
the same; and, as they usually keep well out of sight, it is not
surprising if confusion arise.</div>

<p>Neither cuckoo knows how to build a proper home; a bunch of sticks
dropped carelessly into the bush, where the hapless babies that emerge
from the greenish eggs will not have far to fall when they tumble out
of bed, as they must inevitably do, may by courtesy only be called a
nest. The cuckoo is said to suck the eggs of other birds; but, surely,
such vice is only the rarest dissipation. Insects of many kinds and
"tent caterpillars" chiefly are their chosen food.</p>

<p>"<i>Kak, k-kuk, k-kuk, k-kuk!</i>" like an exaggerated tree-toad's rattle,
is a sound that, when first heard, makes you rush out of doors
instantly to "name" the bird. Look for him in the depths of the tall
shrubbery or low trees, near running water, if there is any in the
neighborhood, and if you are more fortunate than most people, you will
presently become acquainted with the yellow-billed cuckoo. When seen
perching at a little distance, his large, slim body, grayish brown,
with olive tints above and whitish below, can scarcely be
distinguished from that of the black-billed species. It is not until
you get close enough to note the yellow bill, reddish-brown wings, and
black tail feathers with their white "thumb-nail" marks, that you know
which cuckoo you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg_142]</a></span>
watching. In repose the bird looks dazed or stupid, but as it darts
about among the trees after insects, noiselessly slipping to another
one that promises better results, and hopping along the limbs after
performing a series of beautiful evolutions among the branches as it
hunts for its favorite "tent caterpillars," it appears what it really
is: an unusually active, graceful, intelligent bird.</p>

<p>A solitary wanderer, nevertheless one cuckoo in an apple orchard is
worth a hundred robins in ridding it of caterpillars and inch-worms,
for it delights in killing many more of these than it can possibly
eat. In the autumn it varies its diet with minute fresh-water
shell-fish from the swamp and lake. Mulberries, that look so like
caterpillars the bird possibly likes them on that account, it devours
wholesale.</p>

<p>Family cares rest lightly on the cuckoos. The nest of both species is
a ramshackle affair&mdash;a mere bundle of twigs and sticks without a rim
to keep the eggs from rolling from the bush, where they rest, to the
ground. Unlike their European relative, they have the decency to rear
their own young and not impose this heavy task on others; but the
cuckoos on both sides of the Atlantic are most erratic and irregular
in their nesting habits. The overworked mother-bird often lays an egg
while brooding over its nearly hatched companion, and the two or three
half-grown fledglings already in the nest may roll the large greenish
eggs out upon the ground, while both parents are off searching for
food to quiet their noisy clamorings. Such distracting mismanagement
in the nursery is enough to make a homeless wanderer of any father. It
is the mother-bird that tumbles to the ground at your approach from
sheer fright; feigns lameness, trails her wings as she tries to entice
you away from the nest. The male bird shows far less concern; a no
more devoted father, we fear, than he is a lover. It is said he
changes his mate every year.</p>

<p>Altogether, the cuckoo is a very different sort of bird from what our
fancy pictured. The little Swiss creatures of wood that fly out of the
doors of clocks and call out the bed-hour to sleepy children, are
chiefly responsible for the false impressions of our mature years. The
American bird does not repeat its name, and its harsh, grating "<i>kuk,
kuk</i>," does not remotely suggest the sweet voice of its European
relative.</p>

<p>Where a brook cuts its way through a sand bank to reach the sea is an
ideal nesting ground for a colony of sand martins. The face of the
high bank shows a number of clean, round holes indiscriminately bored
into the sand, as if the place had just received a cannonading; but
instead of war an atmosphere of peace pervades the place in midsummer,
when you are most likely to visit it. Now that the young ones have
flown from their nests that your arm can barely reach through the
tunnelled sand or clay, there can be little harm in examining the
feathers dropped from gulls, ducks, and other water-birds with which
the grassy home is lined.</p>

<p>The bank swallow's nest, like the kingfisher's, which it resembles, is
his home as well. There he rests when tired of flying about in pursuit
of insect food. Perhaps a bird that has been resting in one of the
tunnels, startled by your innocent house-breaking, will fly out across
your face, near enough for you to see how unlike the other swallows he
is: smaller, plainer, and with none of their glinting steel-blues and
buffs about him. With strong, swift flight he rejoins his fellows,
wheeling, skimming, darting through the air above you, and uttering
his characteristic "giggling twitter," that is one of the cheeriest
noises heard along the beach. In early October vast numbers of these
swallows may be seen in loose flocks along the Jersey coast, slowly
making their way South. Clouds of them miles in extent are recorded.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;A roving resident, without fixed seasons for

<p>As the cedar birds travel about in great flocks that quickly exhaust
their special food in a neighborhood, they necessarily lead a nomadic
life&mdash;here to-day, gone to-morrow&mdash;and, like the Arabs, they "silently
steal away." It is surprising how very little noise so great a company
of these birds make at any time. That is because they are singularly
gentle and refined; soft of voice, as they are of color, their plumage
suggesting a fine Japanese water-color painting on silk, with its
beautiful sheen and exquisitely blended tints.</p>

<p>One listens in vain for a song; only a lisping "<i>Twee-twee-ze</i>," or "a
dreary whisper," as Minot calls their low-toned communications with
each other, reaches our ears from their high perches in the cedar
trees, where they sit, almost motionless hours at a time, digesting
the enormous quantities of juniper and whortle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg_145]</a></span>
berries, wild cherries, worms, and insects upon which they have
gormandized.</p>

<p>Nuttall gives the cedar birds credit for excessive politeness to each
other. He says he has often seen them passing a worm from one to
another down a whole row of beaks and back again before it was finally
eaten.</p>

<p>When nesting time arrives&mdash;that is to say, towards the end of the
summer&mdash;they give up their gregarious habits and live in pairs,
billing and kissing like turtle-doves in the orchard or wild
crab-trees, where a flat, bulky nest is rather carelessly built of
twigs, grasses, feathers, strings&mdash;any odds and ends that may be lying
about. The eggs are usually four, white tinged with purple and spotted
with black.</p>

<p>Apparently they have no moulting season; their plumage is always the
same, beautifully neat and full-feathered. Nothing ever hurries or
flusters them, their greatest concern apparently being, when they
alight, to settle themselves comfortably between their over-polite
friends, who are never guilty of jolting or crowding. Few birds care
to take life so easily, not to say indolently.</p>

<p>Among the French Canadians they are called R&#233;collet, from the color of
their crest resembling the hood of the religious order of that name.
Every region the birds pass through, local names appear to be applied
to them, a few of the most common of which are given above.</p>

<p>This little brown wood sprite, the very embodiment of virtuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg_146]</a></span>
diligence, is never found far from the nuthatches, titmice, and
kinglets, though not strictly in their company, for he is a rather
solitary bird. Possibly he repels them by being too exasperatingly
conscientious.</p>

<p>Beginning at the bottom of a rough-barked tree (for a smooth bark
conceals no larv&#230;), the creeper silently climbs upward in a sort of
spiral, now lost to sight on the opposite side of the tree, then
reappearing just where he is expected to, flitting back a foot or two,
perhaps, lest he overlooked a single spider egg, but never by any
chance leaving a tree until conscience approves of his thoroughness.
And yet with all this painstaking workman's care, it takes him just
about fifty seconds to finish a tree. Then off he flits to the base of
another, to repeat the spiral process. Only rarely does he adopt the
woodpecker process of partly flitting, partly rocking his way with the
help of his tail straight up one side of the tree.</p>

<p>Yet this little bird is not altogether the soulless drudge he appears.
In the midst of his work, uncheered by summer sunshine, and clinging
with numb toes to the tree-trunk some bitter cold day, he still finds
some tender emotion within him to voice in a "wild, sweet song" that
is positively enchanting at such a time. But it is not often this song
is heard south of his nesting grounds.</p>

<p>The brown creeper's plumage is one of Nature's most successful feats
of mimicry&mdash;an exact counterfeit in feathers of the brown-gray bark on
which the bird lives. And the protective coloring is carried out in
the nest carefully tucked under a piece of loosened bark in the very
heart of the tree.</p>

Uncommon in summer.</div>

<p>A small grayish-brown brindle bird, relieved with touches of yellow on
its back, wings, and tail, may be seen some winter morning roving on
the lawn from one evergreen tree to another, clinging to the pine
cones and peering attentively between the scales before extracting the
kernels. It utters a call-note so like the English sparrow's that you
are surprised when you look up into the tree to find it comes from a
stranger. The pine siskin is an erratic visitor, and there is always
the charm of the unexpected about its coming near our houses that
heightens our enjoyment of its brief stay.</p>

<p>As it flies downward from the top of the spruce tree to feed upon the
brown seeds still clinging to the pigweed and goldenrod stalks
sticking out above the snow by the roadside, it dips and floats
through the air like its charming little cousin, the goldfinch. They
have several characteristics in common besides their flight and their
fondness for thistles. Far at the north, where the pine siskin nests
in the top of the evergreens, his sweet-warbled love-song is said to
be like that of our "wild canary's," only with a suggestion of
fretfulness in the tone.</p>

<p>Occasionally some one living in an Adirondack or other mountain camp
reports finding the nest and hearing the siskin sing even in

however its erratic habits may sometimes break through the
ornithologist's traditions.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;Winter visitor. Without fixed season.</div>

<p>Confined to a narrower range than the Lapland longspur, this bird,
quite commonly found on the open prairie districts of the middle West
in winter, is, nevertheless, so very like its cousin that the same
description of their habits might very well answer for both. Indeed,
both these birds are often seen in the same flock. Larks and the
ubiquitous sparrows, too, intermingle with them with the familiarity
that only the starvation rations of midwinter, and not true
sociability, can effect; and, looking out upon such a heterogeneous
flock of brown birds as they are feeding together on the frozen
ground, only the trained field ornithologist would find it easy to
point out the painted longspurs.</p>

<p>Certain peculiarities are noticeable, however. Longspurs squat while
resting; then, when flushed, they run quickly and lightly, and "rise
with a sharp click, repeated several times in quick succession, and
move with an easy, undulating motion for a short distance, when they
alight very suddenly, seeming to fall perpendicularly several feet to
the ground." Another peculiarity of their flight is their habit of
flying about in circles, to and fro, keeping up a constant chirping or
call. It is only in the mating season, when we rarely hear them, that
the longspurs have the angelic manner of singing as they fly, like the
skylark. The colors of the males, among the several longspurs, may
differ widely, but the indistinctly marked females are so like each
other that only their mates, perhaps, could tell them apart.</p>

<p>This arctic bird, although considered somewhat rare with us, when seen
at all in midwinter is in such large flocks that, before its visit in
the neighborhood is ended, and because there are so few other birds
about, it becomes delightfully familiar as it nimbly runs over the
frozen ground, picking up grain that has blown about from the barn,
when the seeds of the field are buried under snow. This lack of fear
through sharp hunger, that often drives the shyest of the birds to our
very doors in winter, is as pathetic as it is charming. Possibly it is
not so rare a bird as we think, for it is often mistaken for some of
the sparrows, the shore larks, and the snow buntings, that it not only

other longspurs.</p>

<p>At all seasons of the year a ground bird, you may readily identify the
Lapland longspur by its tracks through the snow, showing the mark of
the long hind claw or spur. In summer we know little or nothing about
it, for, with the coming of the flowers, it is off to the far north,
where, we are told, it depresses its nest in a bed of moss upon the
ground, and lines it with fur shed from the coat of the arctic fox.</p>

<p>Who does not know this humblest, most unassuming little neighbor that
comes hopping to our very doors; this mite of a bird with "one talent"
that it so persistently uses all the day and every day throughout the
summer? Its high, wiry trill, like the buzzing of the locust, heard in
the dawn before the sky grows even gray, or in the middle of the
night, starts the morning chorus; and after all other voices are
hushed in the evening, its tremolo is the last bed-song to come from
the trees. But however monotonous such cheerfulness sometimes becomes
when we are surfeited with real songs from dozens of other throats,
there are long periods of midsummer silence that it punctuates most
acceptably.</p>

<p>Its call-note, <i>chip! chip!</i> from which several of its popular names
are derived, is altogether different from the trill which must do duty
as a song to express love, contentment, everything that so amiable a
little nature might feel impelled to voice.</p>

<p>But with all its virtues, the chippy shows lamentable weakness of
character in allowing its grown children to impose upon it, as it
certainly does. In every group of these birds throughout the summer we
can see young ones (which we may know by the black line-stripes on
their breasts) hopping around after their parents, that are often no
larger or more able-bodied than they, and teasing to be fed; drooping
their wings to excite pity for a helplessness that they do not possess
when the weary little mother hops away from them, and still
persistently chirping for food until she weakly relents, returns to
them, picks a seed from the ground and thrusts it down the bill of the
sauciest teaser in the group. With two such broods in a season the
chestnut feathers on the father's jaunty head might well turn gray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg_151]</a></span>
Unlike most of the sparrows, the little chippy frequents high trees,
where its nest is built quite as often as in the low bushes of the
garden. The horsehair, which always lines the grassy cup that holds
its greenish-blue, speckled eggs, is alone responsible for the name
hair-bird, and not the chippy's hair-like trill, as some suppose.</p>

<p>In a bulletin issued by the Department of Agriculture it is shown that

<p>Simply because both birds have chestnut crowns, the field sparrow is
often mistaken for the dapper, sociable chippy; and, no doubt because
it loves such heathery, grassy pastures as are dear to the vesper
sparrow, and has bay wings and a sweet song, these two cousins also
are often confused. The field sparrow has a more reddish-brown upper
back than any of its small relatives; the absence of streaks on its
breast and of the white tail quills so conspicuous in the vesper
sparrow's flight, sufficiently differentiate the two birds, while the
red bill of the field sparrow is a positive mark of identification.</p>

<p>This bird of humble nature, that makes the scrubby pastures and
uplands tuneful from early morning until after sunset, flies away with
exasperating shyness as you approach. Alighting on a convenient
branch, he lures you on with his clear, sweet song. Follow him, and he
only hops about from bush to bush, farther and farther away, singing
as he goes a variety of strains, which is one of the bird's
peculiarities. The song not only varies in individuals, but in
different localities, which may be one reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg_153]</a></span>
why no two ornithologists record it alike. Doubtless the chief reason
for the amusing differences in the syllables into which the songs of
birds are often translated in the books, is that the same notes
actually sound differently to different individuals. Thus, to people
in Massachusetts the white-throated sparrow seems to say, "<i>Pea-bod-y,
Pea-bod-y, Pea-bod-y!</i>" while good British subjects beyond the New
England border hear him sing quite distinctly, "<i>Sweet Can-a-da,
Can-a-da, Can-a-da!</i>" But however the opinions as to the syllables of
the field sparrow's song may differ, all are agreed as to its
exquisite quality, that resembles the vesper sparrow's tender, sweet
melody. The song begins with three soft, wild whistles, and ends with
a series of trills and quavers that gradually melt away into silence:
a serene and restful strain as soothing as a hymn. Like the vesper
sparrows, these birds sometimes build a plain, grassy nest,
unprotected by overhanging bush, flat upon the ground. Possibly from a
prudent fear of field-mice and snakes, the little mother most
frequently lays her bluish-white, rufous-marked eggs in a nest placed
in a bush of a bushy field. Hence John Burroughs has called the bird
the "bush sparrow."</p>

<p>There will be little difficulty in naming this largest, most plump and
reddish of all the sparrows, whose fox-colored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg_154]</a></span>
feathers, rather than any malicious cunning of its disposition, are
responsible for the name it bears. The male bird is incomparably the
finest singer of its gifted family. His faint <i>tseep</i> call-note gives
no indication of his vocal powers that some bleak morning in early
March suddenly send a thrill of pleasure through you. It is the most
welcome "glad surprise" of all the spring. Without a preliminary
twitter or throat-clearing of any sort, the full, rich, luscious
tones, with just a tinge of plaintiveness in them, are poured forth
with spontaneous abandon. Such a song at such a time is enough to
summon anybody with a musical ear out of doors under the leaden skies
to where the delicious notes issue from the leafless shrubbery by the
roadside. Watch the singer until the song ends, when he will quite
likely descend among the dead leaves on the ground and scratch among
them like any barn-yard fowl, but somehow contriving to use both feet
at once in the operation, as no chicken ever could. He seems to take
special delight in damp thickets, where the insects with which he
varies his seed diet are plentiful.</p>

<p>Usually the fox sparrows keep in small, loose flocks, apart by
themselves, for they are not truly gregarious; but they may sometimes
be seen travelling in company with their white-throated cousins. They
are among the last birds to leave us in the late autumn or winter. Mr.
Bicknell says that they seem indisposed to sing unless present in
numbers. Indeed, they are little inclined to absolute solitude at any
time, for even in the nesting season quite a colony of grassy
nurseries may be found in the same meadow, and small companies haunt
the roadside shrubbery during the migrations.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that no other common bird is so frequently
overlooked as this little sparrow, that keeps persistently to the
grass and low bushes, and only faintly lifts up a weak, wiry voice
that is usually attributed to some insect. At the bend of the wings
only are the feathers really yellow, and even this bright shade often
goes unnoticed as the bird runs shyly through an old dairy field or
grassy pasture. You may all but step upon it before it takes wing and
exhibits itself on the fence-rail, which is usually as far from the
ground as it cares to go. If you are near enough to this perch you may
overhear the <i>zee-e-e-e-e-e-e-e</i> that has earned it the name of
grasshopper sparrow. If you persistently follow it too closely, away
it flies, then suddenly drops to the ground where a scrubby bush
affords protection. A curious fact about this bird is that after you
have once become acquainted with it, you find that instead of being a
rare discovery, as you had supposed, it is apt to be a common resident
of almost every field you walk through.</p>

Look for the savanna sparrow in salt marshes, marshy or upland
pastures, never far inland, and if you see a sparrowy bird, unusually
white and heavily streaked beneath, and with pale yellow markings
about the eye and on the bend of the wing, you may still make several
guesses at its identity before the weak, little insect-like trill
finally establishes it. Whoever can correctly name every sparrow and
warbler on sight is a person to be envied, if, indeed, he exists at
all.</p>

<p>In the lowlands of Nova Scotia and, in fact, of all the maritime
provinces, this sparrow is the one that is perhaps most commonly seen.
Every fence-rail has one perched upon it, singing "<i>Ptsip, ptsip,
ptsip, zee-e-e-e-e</i>" close to the ear of the passer-by, who otherwise
might not hear the low grasshopper-like song. At the north the bird
somehow loses the shyness that makes it comparatively little known
farther south. Depending upon the scrub and grass to conceal it, you
may almost tread upon it before it startles you by its sudden rising
with a whirring noise, only to drop to the ground again just as
suddenly a few yards farther away, where it scuds among the underbrush
and is lost to sight. Tall weeds and fence-rails are as high and
exposed situations as it is likely to select while singing. It is most
distinctively a ground bird, and flat upon the pasture or in a
slightly hollowed cup it has the merest apology for a nest. Only a few
wisps of grass are laid in the cavity to receive the pale-green eggs,
that are covered most curiously with blotches of brown of many shapes
and tints.</p>

The savanna, the swamp, the sharp-tailed, and the song sparrows may
all sometimes be found in the haunts of the seaside sparrow, but you
may be certain of finding the latter nowhere else than in the salt
marshes within sight or sound of the sea. It is a dingy little bird,
with the least definite coloring of all the sparrows that have
maritime inclinations, with no rufous tint in its feathers, and less
distinct streakings on the breast than any of them. It has no black
markings on the back.</p>

<p>Good-sized flocks of seaside sparrows live together in the marshes;
but they spend so much of their time on the ground, running about
among the reeds and grasses, whose seeds and insect parasites they
feed upon, that not until some unusual disturbance in the quiet place
flushes them does the intruder suspect their presence, Hunters after
beach-birds, longshoremen, seaside cottagers, and whoever follows the
windings of a creek through the salt meadows to catch crabs and eels
in midsummer, are well acquainted with the "meadow chippies," as the
fishermen call them. They keep up a good deal of chirping,
sparrow-fashion, and have four or five notes resembling a song that is
usually delivered from a tall reed stalk, where the bird sways and
balances until his husky performance has ended, when down he drops
upon the ground out of sight. Sometimes, too, these notes are uttered
while the bird flutters in the air above the tops of the sedges.</p>

This bird delights in the company of the dull-colored seaside sparrow,
whose haunts in the salt marshes it frequents, especially the drier
parts; but its pointed tail-quills and more distinct markings are
sufficient to prevent confusion. Mr. J. Dwight, Jr., who has made a
special study of maritime birds, says of it: "It runs about among the
reeds and grasses with the celerity of a mouse, and it is not apt to
take wing unless closely pressed." (Wilson credited it with the
nimbleness of a sandpiper.) "It builds its nest in the tussocks on the
bank of a ditch, or in the drift left by the tide, rather than in the
grassier sites chosen by its neighbors, the seaside sparrows."</p>

<p>Only rarely does one get a glimpse of this shy little bird, that darts
out of sight like a flash at the first approach. Balancing on a
cat-tail stalk or perched upon a bit of driftwood, it makes a feeble,
husky attempt to sing a few notes; and during the brief performance
the opera-glasses may search it out successfully. While it feeds upon
the bits of sea-food washed ashore to the edge of the marshes, it
gives us perhaps the best chance we ever get, outside of a museum, to
study the bird's characteristics of plumage.</p>

<p>"Both the sharp-tailed and the seaside finches are crepuscular," says
Dr. Abbott, in "The Birds About Us." They run up and down the reeds
and on the water's edge long after most birds have gone to sleep.</p>

<p>Here is a veritable bird neighbor, if ever there was one; at home in
our gardens and hedges, not often farther away than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg_159]</a></span>
roadside, abundant everywhere during nearly every month in the
year, and yet was there ever one too many? There is scarcely an hour
in the day, too, when its delicious, ecstatic song may not be heard;
in the darkness of midnight, just before dawn, when its voice is
almost the first to respond to the chipping sparrow's wiry trill and
the robin's warble; in the cool of the morning, the heat of noon, the
hush of evening&mdash; ever the simple, homely, sweet melody that
every good American has learned to love in childhood. What the bird
lacks in beauty it abundantly makes up in good cheer. Not at all
retiring, though never bold, it chooses some conspicuous perch on a
bush or tree to deliver its outburst of song, and sings away with
serene unconsciousness. Its artlessness is charming. Thoreau writes in
his "Summer" that the country girls in Massachusetts hear the bird
say: "<i>Maids, maids, maids, hang on your teakettle,
teakettle-ettle-ettle.</i>" The call-note, a metallic <i>chip</i>, is equally
characteristic of the bird's irrepressible vivacity. It has still
another musical expression, however, a song more prolonged and varied
than its usual performance, that it seems to sing only on the wing.</p>

<p>Of course, the song sparrow must sometimes fly upward, but whoever
sees it fly anywhere but downward into the thicket that it depends
upon to conceal it from too close inspection? By pumping its tail as
it flies, it seems to acquire more than the ordinary sparrow's
velocity.</p>

<p>Its nest, which is likely to be laid flat on the ground, except where
field-mice are plentiful (in which case it is elevated into the crotch
of a bush), is made of grass, strips of bark, and leaves, and lined
with finer grasses and hair. Sometimes three broods may be reared in a
season, but even the cares of providing insects and seeds enough for
so many hungry babies cannot altogether suppress the cheerful singer.
The eggs are grayish white, speckled and clouded with lavender and
various shades of brown.</p>

<p>In sparsely settled regions the song sparrows seem to show a fondness
for moist woodland thickets, possibly because their tastes are
insectivorous. But it is difficult to imagine the friendly little
musician anything but a neighbor.</p>

<p>In just such impenetrable retreats as the marsh wrens choose, another
wee brown bird may sometimes be seen springing up from among the
sedges, singing a few sweet notes as it flies and floats above them,
and then suddenly disappearing into the grassy tangle. It is too
small, and its breast is not streaked enough to be a song sparrow,
neither are their songs alike; it has not the wren's peculiarities of
bill and tail. Its bright-bay crown and sparrowy markings finally
identify it. A suggestion of the bird's watery home shows itself in
the liquid quality of its simple, sweet note, stronger and sweeter
than the chippy's, and repeated many times almost like a trill that
seems to trickle from the marsh in a little rivulet of song. The
sweetness is apt to become monotonous to all but the bird itself, that
takes evident delight in its performance. In the spring, when flocks
of swamp sparrows come north, how they enliven the marshes and waste
places! And yet the song, simple as it is, is evidently not uttered
altogether without effort, if the tail-spreading and teetering of the
body after the manner of the ovenbird, are any indications of
exertion.</p>

<p>Nuttall says of these birds: "They thread their devious way with the
same alacrity as the rail, with whom, indeed, they are often
associated in neighborhood. In consequence of this perpetual brushing
through sedge and bushes, their feathers are frequently so worn that
their tails appear almost like those of rats."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg_161]</a></span>
But the swamp sparrows frequently belie their name, and, especially in
the South, live in dry fields, worn-out pasture lands with scrubby,
weedy patches in them. They live upon seeds of grasses and berries,
but Dr. Abbott has detected their special fondness for fish&mdash;not
fresh fish particularly, but rather such as have lain in the sun for a
few days and become dry as a chip.</p>

<p>Their nest is placed on the ground, sometimes in a tussock of grass or
roots of an upturned tree quite surrounded by water. Four or five
soiled white eggs with reddish-brown spots are laid usually twice in a
season.</p>

<p>A revised and enlarged edition of the friendly little chipping
sparrow, that hops to our very doors for crumbs throughout the mild
weather, comes out of British America at the beginning of winter to
dissipate much of the winter's dreariness by his cheerful twitterings.
Why he should have been called a tree sparrow is a mystery, unless
because he does not frequent trees&mdash;a reason with sufficient
plausibility to commend the name to several of the early
ornithologists, who not infrequently called a bird precisely what it
was not. The tree sparrow actually does not show half the preference
for trees that its familiar little counterpart does, but rather keeps
to low bushes when not on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg_162]</a></span>
ground, where we usually find it. It does not crouch upon the ground
like the chippy, but with a lordly carriage holds itself erect as it
nimbly runs over the frozen crust. Sheltered from the high, wintry
winds in the furrows and dry ditches of ploughed fields, a loose flock
of these active birds keep up a merry hunt for fallen seeds and
berries, with a belated beetle to give the grain a relish. As you
approach the feeding ground, one bird gives a shrill alarm-cry, and
instantly five times as many birds as you suspected were in the field
take wing and settle down in the scrubby undergrowth at the edge of
the woods or by the way-side. No still cold seems too keen for them to
go a-foraging; but when cutting winds blow through the leafless
thickets the scattered remnants of a flock seek the shelter of stone
walls, hedges, barns, and cozy nooks about the house and garden. It is
in midwinter that these birds grow most neighborly, although even then
they are distinctly less sociable than their small chippy cousins.</p>

<p>By the first of March, when the fox sparrow and the bluebird attract
the lion's share of attention by their superior voices, we not
infrequently are deaf to the modest, sweet little strain that answers
for the tree sparrow's love-song. Soon after the bird is in full
voice, away it goes with its flock to their nesting ground in Labrador
or the Hudson Bay region. It builds, either on the ground or not far
from it, a nest of grasses, rootlets, and hair, without which no true
chippy counts its home complete.</p>

<p>Among the least conspicuous birds, sparrows are the easiest to
classify for that very reason, and certain prominent features of the
half dozen commonest of the tribe make their identification simple
even to the merest novice. The distinguishing marks of this sparrow
that haunts open, breezy pasture lands and country waysides are its
bright, reddish-brown wing coverts, prominent among its dingy, pale
brownish-gray feathers, and its white tail-quills, shown as the bird
flies along the road ahead of you to light upon the fence-rail. It
rarely flies higher, even to sing its serene, pastoral strain, restful
as the twilight, of which, indeed, it seems to be the vocal
expression. How different from the ecstatic outburst of the song
sparrow! Pensive, but not sad, its long-drawn silvery notes continue
in quavers that float off unended like a trail of mist. The song is
suggestive of the thoughts that must come at evening to some New
England saint of humble station after a well-spent, soul-uplifting
day.</p>

<p>But while the vesper sparrow sings oftenest and most sweetly in the
late afternoon and continues singing until only he and the
rose-breasted grosbeak break the silence of the early night, his is
one of the first voices to join the morning chorus. No "early worm,"
however, tempts him from his grassy nest, for the seeds in the pasture
lands and certain tiny insects that live among the grass furnish meals
at all hours. He simply delights in the cool, still morning and
evening hours and in giving voice to his enjoyment of them.</p>

<p>The vesper sparrow is pre&#235;minently a grass-bird. It first opens its
eyes on the world in a nest neatly woven of grasses, laid on the
ground among the grass that shelters it and furnishes it with food and
its protective coloring. Only the grazing cattle know how many nests
and birds are hidden in their pastures. Like the meadowlarks, their
presence is not even suspected until a flock is flushed from its
feeding ground, only to return to the spot when you have passed on
your way. Like the meadowlark again, the vesper sparrow occasionally
sings as it soars upward from its grassy home.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Migrations</i>&mdash;October. April. Irregular migrant in Northern

<p>The large size and handsome markings of this aristocratic-looking
Northern sparrow would serve to distinguish him at once, did he not
often consort with his equally fine-looking white-throated cousins
while migrating, and so too often get overlooked. Sparrows are such
gregarious birds that it is well to scrutinize every flock with
especial care in the spring and autumn, when the rarer migrants are
passing. This bird is more common in the high altitudes of the Sierra
Nevada and Rocky Mountains than elsewhere in the United States. There
in the lonely forest it nests in low bushes or on the ground, and
sings its full love-song, as it does in the northern British
provinces, along the Atlantic coast; but during the migrations it
favors us only with selections from its repertoire. Mr. Ernest
Thompson says, "Its usual song is like the latter half of the
white-throat's familiar refrain, repeated a number of times with a
peculiar, sad cadence and in a clear, soft whistle that is
characteristic of the group." "The song is the loudest and most
plaintive of all the sparrow songs," says John Burroughs. "It begins
with the words <i>fe-u, fe-u, fe-u</i>, and runs off into trills and
quavers like the song sparrow's, only much more touching." Colorado
miners tell that this sparrow, like its white-throated relative, sings
on the darkest nights. Often a score or more birds are heard singing
at once after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg_165]</a></span>
habit of the European nightingales, which, however, choose to sing
only in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"<i>I-I, Pea-body, Pea-body, Pea-body</i>," are the syllables of the
white-throat's song heard by the good New Englanders, who have a
tradition that you must either be a Peabody or a nobody there; while
just over the British border the bird is distinctly understood to say,
"<i>Swee-e-e-t Can-a-da, Can-a-da, Can-a-da.</i>" "<i>All day, whit-tle-ing,
whit-tle-ing, whit-tle-ing,</i>" the Maine people declare he sings; and
Hamilton Gibson told of a perplexed farmer, Peverly by name, who, as
he stood in the field undecided as to what crop to plant, clearly
heard the bird advise, "<i>Sow wheat, Pev-er-ly, Pev-er-ly, Pev-er-ly.</i>"
Such divergence of opinion, which is really slight compared with the
verbal record of many birds' songs, only goes to show how little the
sweetness of birds' music, like the perfume of a rose, depends upon a
name.</p>

<p>In a family not distinguished for good looks, the white-throated
sparrow is conspicuously handsome, especially after the spring moult.
In midwinter the feathers grow dingy and the markings indistinct; but
as the season advances, his colors are sure to brighten perceptibly,
and before he takes the northward journey in April, any little lady
sparrow might feel proud of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg_166]</a></span>
attentions of so fine-looking and sweet-voiced a lover. The black,
white, and yellow markings on his head are now clear and beautiful.
His figure is plump and aristocratic.</p>

<p>These sparrows are particularly sociable travellers, and cordially
welcome many stragglers to their flocks&mdash;not during the migrations
only, but even when winter's snow affords only the barest gleanings
above it. Then they boldly peck about the dog's plate by the kitchen
door and enter the barn-yard, calling their feathered friends with a
sharp <i>tseep</i> to follow them. Seeds and insects are their chosen food,
and were they not well wrapped in an adipose coat under their
feathers, there must be many a winter night when they would go
shivering, supperless, to their perch.</p>

<p>In the dark of midnight one may sometimes hear the white-throat softly
singing in its dreams.</p>

<p>The earliest of the family to appear in the spring, the tree swallow
comes skimming over the freshly ploughed fields with a wide sweep of
the wings, in what appears to be a perfect ecstasy of flight. More shy
of the haunts of man, and less gregarious than its cousins, it is
usually to be seen during migration flying low over the marshes,
ponds, and streams with a few chosen friends, keeping up an incessant
warbling twitter while performing their bewildering and tireless
evolutions as they catch their food on the wing. Their white breasts
flash in the sunlight, and it is only when they dart near you, and
skim close along the surface of the water, that you discover their
backs to be not black, but rich, dark green, glossy to iridescence.</p>

<p>It is probable that these birds keep near the waterways because their
favorite insects and wax-berries are more plentiful in such places;
but this peculiarity has led many people to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg_170]</a></span>
absurd belief that the tree swallow buries itself under the mud of
ponds in winter in a state of hibernation. No bird's breathing
apparatus is made to operate under mud.</p>

<p>In unsettled districts these swallows nest in hollow trees, hence
their name; but with that laziness that forms a part of the degeneracy
of civilization, they now gladly accept the boxes about men's homes
set up for the martins. Thousands of these beautiful birds have been
shot on the Long Island marshes and sold to New York epicures for
snipe.</p>

<p>This smallest, most exquisite and unabashed of our bird neighbors
cannot be mistaken, for it is the only one of its kin found east of
the plains and north of Florida, although about four hundred species,
native only to the New World, have been named by scientists. How does
it happen that this little tropical jewel alone flashes about our
Northern gardens? Does it never stir the spirit of adventure and
emulation in the glistening breasts of its stay-at-home cousins in the
tropics by tales of luxuriant tangles of honeysuckle and clematis on
our cottage porches; of deep-cupped trumpet-flowers climbing over the
walls of old-fashioned gardens, where larkspur, narcissus, roses, and
phlox, that crowd the box-edged beds, are more gay and honey-laden than their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg_171]</a></span>
little brains can picture? Apparently it takes only the wish to be in
a place to transport one of these little fairies either from the
honeysuckle trellis to the canna bed or from Yucatan to the Hudson. It
is easy to see how to will and to fly are allied in the minds of the
humming-birds, as they are in the Latin tongue. One minute poised in
midair, apparently motionless before a flower while draining the
nectar from its deep cup&mdash;though the humming of its wings tells
that it is suspended there by no magic&mdash;the next instant it has
flashed out of sight as if a fairy's wand had made it suddenly
invisible. Without seeing the hummer, it might be, and often is,
mistaken for a bee improving the "shining hour."</p>

<p>At evening one often hears of a "humming-bird" going the rounds of the
garden, but at this hour it is usually the sphinx-moth hovering above
the flower-beds&mdash;the one other creature besides the bee for which the
bird is ever mistaken. The postures and preferences of this beautiful
large moth make the mistake a very natural one.</p>

<p>The ruby-throat is strangely fearless and unabashed. It will dart
among the vines on the veranda while the entire household are
assembled there, and add its hum to that of the conversation in a most
delightfully neighborly way. Once a glistening little sprite, quite
undaunted by the size of an audience that sat almost breathless
enjoying his beauty, thrust his bill into one calyx after another on a
long sprig of honeysuckle held in the hand.</p>

<p>And yet, with all its friendliness&mdash;or is it simply fearlessness?&mdash;the
bird is a desperate duellist, and will longe his deadly blade into the
jewelled breast of an enemy at the slightest provocation and quicker
than thought. All the heat of his glowing throat seems to be
transferred to his head while the fight continues, sometimes even to
the death&mdash;a cruel, but marvellously beautiful sight as the glistening
birds dart and tumble about beyond the range of peace-makers.</p>

<p>High up in a tree, preferably one whose knots and lichen-covered
excrescences are calculated to help conceal the nest that so cleverly
imitates them, the mother humming-bird saddles her exquisite cradle to
a horizontal limb. She lines it with plant-down, fluffy bits from
cat-tails, and the fronds of fern, felting the material into a circle
that an elm-leaf amply roofs over. Outside, lichens or bits of bark
blend the nest so harmoniously with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg_172]</a></span>
its surroundings that one may look long and thoroughly before
discovering it. Two infinitesimal, white eggs tax the nest
accommodation to its utmost.</p>

<p>In the mating season the female may be seen perching&mdash;a posture one
rarely catches her gay lover in&mdash;preening her dainty but sombre
feathers with ladylike nicety. The young birds do a great deal of
perching before they gain the marvellously rapid wing-motions of
maturity, but they are ready to fly within three weeks after they are
hatched. By the time the trumpet-vine is in bloom they dart and sip
and utter a shrill little squeak among the flowers, in company with
the old birds.</p>

<p>During the nest-building and incubation the male bird keeps so
aggressively on the defensive that he often betrays to a hitherto
unsuspecting intruder the location of his home. After the young birds
have to be fed he is most diligent in collecting food, that consists
not alone of the sweet juices of flowers, as is popularly supposed,
but also of aphides and plant-lice that his proboscis-like tongue
licks off the garden foliage literally like a streak of lightning.</p>

<p>Both parents feed the young by regurgitation&mdash;a process disgusting to
the human observer, whose stomach involuntarily revolts at the sight
so welcome to the tiny, squeaking, hungry birds.</p>

A trifle larger than the golden-crowned kinglet, with a vermilion
crest instead of a yellow and flame one, and with a decided preference
for a warmer winter climate, and the ruby-crown's chief distinguishing
characteristics are told. These rather confusing relatives would be
less puzzling if it were the habit of either to keep quiet long enough
to focus the opera-glasses on their crowns, which it only rarely is
while some particularly promising haunt of insects that lurk beneath
the rough bark of the evergreens has to be thoroughly explored. At all
other times both kinglets keep up an incessant fluttering and
twinkling among the twigs and leaves at the ends of the branches,
jerking their tiny bodies from twig to twig in the shrubbery, hanging
head downward, like a nuthatch, and most industriously feeding every
second upon the tiny insects and larv&#230; hidden beneath the bark and
leaves. They seem to be the feathered expression of perpetual motion.
And how dainty and charming these tiny sprites are! They are not at
all shy; you may approach them quite close if you will, for the birds
are simply too intent on their business to be concerned with yours.</p>

<p>If a sharp lookout be kept for these ruby-crowned migrants, that too
often slip away to the south before we know they have come, we notice
that they appear about a fortnight ahead of the golden-crested
species, since the mild, soft air of our Indian summer is exactly to
their liking. At this season there is nothing in the bird's "thin,
metallic call-note, like a vibrating wire," to indicate that he is one
of our finest songsters. But listen for him during the spring
migration, when a love-song is already ripening in his tiny throat.
What a volume of rich, lyrical melody pours from the Norway spruce,
where the little musician is simply practising to perfect the richer,
fuller song that he sings to his nesting mate in the far north! The
volume is really tremendous, coming from so tiny a throat. Those who
have heard it in northern Canada describe it as a flute-like and
mellow warble full of intricate phrases past the imitating. Dr. Coues
says of it: "The kinglet's exquisite vocalization defies description."</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the nest of this bird, that is not at all rare, has
been discovered only six times. It would appear to be over-large for
the tiny bird, until we remember that kinglets are wont to have a
numerous progeny in their pensile, globular home. It is made of light,
flimsy material&mdash;moss, strips of bark, and plant-fibre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg_174]</a></span>
well knit together and closely lined with feathers, which must be a
grateful addition to the babies, where they are reared in evergreens
in cold, northern woods.</p>

<p>If this cheery little winter neighbor would keep quiet long enough, we
might have a glimpse of the golden crest that distinguishes him from
his equally lively cousin, the ruby-crowned; but he is so constantly
flitting about the ends of the twigs, peering at the bark for hidden
insects, twinkling his wings and fluttering among the evergreens with
more nervous restlessness than a vireo, that you may know him well
before you have a glimpse of his tri-colored crown.</p>

<p>When the autumn foliage is all aglow with yellow and flame this tiny
sprite comes out of the north, where neither nesting nor moulting
could rob him of his cheerful spirits. Except the humming-bird and the
winter wren, he is the smallest bird we have. And yet, somewhere
stored up in his diminutive body, is warmth enough to withstand zero
weather. With evident enjoyment of the cold, he calls out a shrill,
wiry <i>zee, zee, zee</i>, that rings merrily from the pines and spruces
when our fingers are too numb to hold the opera glasses in an attempt
to follow his restless flittings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg_175]</a></span>
from branch to branch. Is it one of the unwritten laws of birds that
the smaller their bodies the greater their activity?</p>

<p>When you see one kinglet about, you may be sure there are others not
far away, for, except in the nesting season, its habits are distinctly
social, its friendliness extending to the humdrum brown creeper, the
chickadees, and the nuthatches, in whose company it is often seen;
indeed, it is likely to be in almost any flock of the winter birds.
They are a merry band as they go exploring the trees together. The
kinglet can hang upside down, too, like the other acrobats, many of
whose tricks he has learned; and it can pick off insects from a tree
with as business-like an air as the brown creeper, but with none of
that soulless bird's plodding precision.</p>

<p>In the early spring, just before this busy little sprite leaves us to
nest in Canada or Labrador&mdash;for heat is the one thing that he can't
cheerfully endure&mdash;a gushing, lyrical song bursts from his tiny
throat&mdash;a song whose volume is so out of proportion to the bird's size
that Nuttall's classification of kinglets with wrens doesn't seem far
wrong after all.</p>

<p>Only rarely is a nest found so far south as the White Mountains. It is
said to be extraordinarily large for so small a bird; but that need
not surprise us when we learn that as many as ten creamy-white eggs,
blotched with brown and lavender, are no uncommon number for the
pensile cradle to hold. How do the tiny parents contrive to cover so
many eggs and to feed such a nestful of fledglings?</p>

<p>By no means the recluse that its name would imply, the solitary vireo,
while a bird of the woods, shows a charming curiosity about the
stranger with opera-glasses in hand, who has penetrated to the deep,
swampy tangles, where it chooses to live. Peering at you through the
green undergrowth with an eye that seems especially conspicuous
because of its encircling white rim, it is at least as sociable and
cheerful as any member of its family, and Mr. Bradford Torrey credits
it with "winning tameness." "Wood-bird as it is," he says, "it will
sometimes permit the greatest familiarities. Two birds I have seen,
which allowed themselves to be stroked in the freest manner, while
sitting on the eggs, and which ate from my hand as readily as any pet
canary."</p>

<p>The solitary vireo also builds a pensile nest, swung from the crotch
of a branch, not so high from the ground as the yellow-throated
vireo's nor so exquisitely finished, but still a beautiful little
structure of pine-needles, plant-fibre, dry leaves, and twigs, all
lichen-lined and bound and rebound with coarse spiders' webs.</p>

<p>The distinguishing quality of this vireo's celebrated song is its
tenderness: a pure, serene uplifting of its loving, trustful nature
that seems inspired by a fine spirituality.</p>

"You see it&mdash;you know it&mdash;do you hear me? Do you believe it?" is
Wilson Flagg's famous interpretation of the song of this commonest of
all the vireos, that you cannot mistake with such a key. He calls the
bird the preacher from its declamatory style: an up-and-down warble
delivered with a rising inflection at the close and followed by an
impressive silence, as if the little green orator were saying, "I
pause for a reply."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its quiet coloring, that so closely resembles the
leaves it hunts among, this vireo is rather more noticeable than its
relatives because of its slaty cap and the black-and-white lines over
its ruby eye, that, in addition to the song, are its marked
characteristics.</p>

<p>Whether she is excessively stupid or excessively kind, the
mother-vireo has certainly won for herself no end of ridicule by
allowing the cowbird to deposit a stray egg in the exquisitely made,
pensile nest, where her own tiny white eggs are lying; and though the
young cowbird crowd and worry her little fledglings and eat their
dinner as fast as she can bring it in, no displeasure or grudging is
shown towards the dusky intruder that is sure to upset the rightful
heirs out of the nest before they are able to fly.</p>

<p>In the heat of a midsummer noon, when nearly every other bird's voice
is hushed, and only the locust seems to rejoice in the fierce
sunshine, the little red-eyed vireo goes persistently about its
business of gathering insects from the leaves, not flitting nervously
about like a warbler, or taking its food on the wing like a
flycatcher, but patiently and industriously dining where it can, and
singing as it goes.</p>

<p>When a worm is caught it is first shaken against a branch to kill it
before it is swallowed. Vireos haunt shrubbery and trees with heavy
foliage, all their hunting, singing, resting, and home-building being
done among the leaves&mdash;never on the ground.</p>

<p>"Pertest of songsters," the white-eyed vireo makes whatever
neighborhood it enters lively at once. Taking up a residence in the
tangled shrubbery or thickety undergrowth, it immediately begins to
scold like a crotchety old wren. It becomes irritated over the merest
trifles&mdash;a passing bumblebee, a visit from another bird to its tangle,
an unsuccessful peck at a gnat&mdash;anything seems calculated to rouse its
wrath and set every feather on its little body a-trembling, while it
sharply snaps out what might perhaps be freely constructed into
"cuss-words."</p>

<p>And yet the inscrutable mystery is that this virago meekly permits the
lazy cowbird to deposit an egg in its nest, and will patiently sit
upon it, though it is as large as three of her own tiny eggs; and when
the little interloper comes out from his shell the mother-bird will
continue to give it the most devoted care long after it has shoved her
poor little starved babies out of the nest to meet an untimely death
in the smilax thicket below.</p>

<p>An unusual variety of expression distinguishes this bird's voice from
the songs of the other vireos, which are apt to be monotonous, as they
are incessant. If you are so fortunate to approach the white-eyed
vireo before he suspects your presence, you may hear him amusing
himself by jumbling together snatches of the songs of the other birds
in a sort of potpourri; or perhaps he will be scolding or arguing with
an imaginary foe, then dropping his voice and talking confidentially
to himself. Suddenly he bursts into a charming, simple little song, as
if the introspection had given him reason for real joy. All these
vocal accomplishments suggest the chat at once; but the minute your
intrusion is discovered the sharp scolding, that is fairly screamed at
you from an enraged little throat, leaves no possible shadow of a
doubt as to the bird you have disturbed. It has the most emphatic call
and song to be heard in the woods; it snaps its words off very short.
"<i>Chick-a-rer chick</i>" is its usual call-note, jerked out with great
spitefulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg_179]</a></span>
Wilson thus describes the jealously guarded nest: "This
bird builds a very neat little nest, often in the figure of an
inverted cone; it is suspended by the upper end of the two sides, on
the circular bend of a prickly vine, a species of smilax, that
generally grows in low thickets. Outwardly it is constructed of
various light materials, bits of rotten wood, fibres of dry stalks, of
weeds, pieces of paper (commonly newspapers, an article almost always
found about its nest, so that some of my friends have given it the
name of the politician); all these materials are interwoven with the
silk of the caterpillars, and the inside is lined with fine, dry grass
and hair."</p>

<p>This musical little bird shows a curious preference for rows of trees
in the village street or by the roadside, where he can be sure of an
audience to listen to his rich, continuous warble. There is a
mellowness about his voice, which rises loud, but not altogether
cheerfully, above the bird chorus, as if he were a gifted but slightly
disgruntled contralto. Too inconspicuously dressed, and usually too
high in the tree-top to be identified without opera-glasses, we may
easily mistake him by his voice for one of the warbler family, which
is very closely allied to the vireos. Indeed, this warbling vireo
seems to be the connecting link between them.</p>

<p>Morning and afternoon, but almost never in the evening, we may hear
him rippling out song after song as he feeds on insects and berries
about the garden. But this familiarity lasts only until nesting time,
for off he goes with his little mate to some unfrequented

<p>Early in May you may have the good fortune to see this little bird of
the woods strutting in and out of the garden shrubbery with a certain
mock dignity, like a child wearing its father's boots. Few birds can
walk without appearing more or less ridiculous, and however gracefully
and prettily it steps, this amusing little wagtail is no exception.
When seen at all&mdash;which is not often, for it is shy&mdash;it is usually on
the ground, not far from the shrubbery or a woodland thicket, under
which it will quickly dodge out of sight at the merest suspicion of a
footstep. To most people the bird is only a voice calling, <i><span class="caption2nb">"</span><span class="caption4nb">TEACHER</span>,
<span class="caption3nb smcap">teacher</span>, <span class="caption3nb">TEACHER</span>, <span class="caption2nb">TEACHER</span>, <span class="caption2">TEACHER!"</span></i>" as Mr. Burroughs has interpreted
the notes that go off in pairs like a series of little explosions,
softly at first, then louder and louder and more shrill until the bird
that you at first thought far away seems to be shrieking his
penetrating crescendo into your very ears. But you may look until you
are tired before you find him in the high, dry wood, never near water.</p>

<p>In the driest parts of the wood, here the ground is thickly carpeted
with dead leaves, you may some day notice a little bunch of them, that
look as if a plant, in pushing its way up through the ground, had
raised the leaves, rootlets, and twigs a trifle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg_181]</a></span>
Examine the spot more carefully, and on one side you find an opening,
and within the ball of earth, softly lined with grass, lie four or
five cream-white, speckled eggs. It is only by a happy accident that
this nest of the ovenbird is discovered. The concealment could not be
better. It is this peculiarity of nest construction&mdash;in shape
like a Dutch oven&mdash;that has given the bird what DeKay considers
its "trivial name." Not far from the nest the parent birds scratch
about in the leaves like diminutive barn-yard fowls, for the grubs and
insects hiding under them. But at the first suspicion of an intruder
their alarm becomes pitiful. Panic-stricken, they become fairly limp
with fear, and drooping her wings and tail, the mother-bird drags
herself hither and thither over the ground.</p>

<p>As utterly bewildered as his mate, the male darts, flies, and tumbles
about through the low branches, jerking and wagging his tail in
nervous spasms until you have beaten a double-quick retreat.</p>

<p>In nesting time, at evening, a very few have heard the "luxurious
nuptial song" of the ovenbird; but it is a song to haunt the memory
forever afterward. Burroughs appears to be the first writer to record
this "rare bit of bird melody." "Mounting by easy flight to the top of
the tallest tree," says the author of "Wake-Robin," "the ovenbird
launches into the air with a sort of suspended, hovering flight, like
certain of the finches, and bursts into a perfect ecstasy of
song&mdash;clear, ringing, copious, rivalling the goldfinch's in vivacity
and the linnet's in melody."</p>

In the Delaware Valley and along the same parallel, this inconspicuous
warbler is abundant, but north of New Jersey it is rare enough to give
an excitement to the day on which you discover it. No doubt it is
commoner than we suppose, for its coloring blends so admirably with
its habitats that it is probably very often overlooked. Its call-note,
a common chirp, has nothing distinguishing about it, and all
ornithologists confess to having been often misled by its song into
thinking it came from the chipping sparrow. It closely resembles that
of the pine warbler also. If it were as nervously active as most
warblers, we should more often discover it, but it is quite as
deliberate as a vireo, and in the painstaking way in which it often
circles around a tree while searching for spiders and other insects
that infest the trunks, it reminds us of the brown creeper. Sunny
slopes and hillsides covered with thick undergrowth are its preferred
foraging and nesting haunts. It is often seen hopping directly on the
dry ground, where it places its nest, and it never mounts far above
it. The well-drained, sunny situation for the home is chosen with the
wisdom of a sanitary expert.</p>

<p>When all our northern landscape takes on the exquisite, soft green,
gray, and yellow tints of early spring, this little flycatcher, in
perfect color-harmony with the woods it darts among, comes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg_183]</a></span>
out of the south. It might be a leaf that is being blown about,
touched by the sunshine filtering through the trees, and partly shaded
by the young foliage casting its first shadows.</p>

<p>Woodlands, through which small streams meander lazily, inviting swarms
of insects to their boggy shores, make ideal hunting grounds for the
Acadian flycatcher. It chooses a low rather than a high, conspicuous
perch, that other members of its family invariably select; and from
such a lookout it may be seen launching into the air after the passing
gnat&mdash;darting downward, then suddenly mounting upward in its a&#235;rial
hunt, the vigorous clicks of the beak as it closes over its tiny
victims testifying to the bird's unerring aim and its hearty appetite.</p>

<p>While perching, a constant tail-twitching is kept up; and a faint,
fretful "<i>Tshee-kee, tshee-kee</i>" escapes the bird when inactively
waiting for a dinner to heave in sight.</p>

<p>In the Middle Atlantic States its peeping sound and the clicking of
its parti-colored bill are infrequently heard in the village streets
in the autumn, when the shy and solitary birds are enticed from the
deep woods by a prospect of a more plentiful diet of insects,
attracted by the fruit in orchards and gardens.</p>

<p>Never far from the ground, on two or more parallel branches, the
shallow, unsubstantial nest is laid. Some one has cleverly described
it as "a tuft of hay caught by the limb from a load driven under it,"
but this description omits all mention of the quantities of blossoms
that must be gathered to line the cradle for the tiny, cream white
eggs spotted with brown.</p>

<p>This is the most yellow of the small flycatchers and the only Eastern
species with a yellow instead of a white throat. Without hearing its
call-note, "<i>pse-ek-pse-ek</i>," which it abruptly sneezes rather than
utters, it is quite impossible, as it darts among the trees, to tell
it from the Acadian flycatcher, with which even Audubon confounded it.
Both these little birds choose the same sort of
retreats&mdash;well-timbered woods near a stream that attracts myriads of
insects to its spongy shores&mdash;and both are rather shy and solitary.
The yellow-bellied species has a far more northerly range, however,
than its Southern relative or even the small green-crested flycatcher.
It is rare in the Middle States, not common even in New England,
except in the migrations, but from the Canada border northward its
soft, plaintive whistle, which is its love-song, may be heard in every
forest where it nests. All the flycatchers seem to make a noise with
so much struggle, such convulsive jerkings of head and tail, and
flutterings of the wings that, considering the scanty success of their
musical attempts, it is surprising they try to lift their voices at
all when the effort almost literally lifts them off their feet.</p>

<p>While this little flycatcher is no less erratic than its Acadian
cousin, its nest is never slovenly. One couple had their home in a
wild-grape bower in Pennsylvania; a Virginia creeper in New Jersey
supported another cradle that was fully twenty feet above the ground;
but in Labrador, where the bird has its chosen breeding grounds, the
bulky nest is said to be invariably placed either in the moss by the
brookside or in some old stump, should the locality be too swampy.</p>

<p>There can be little difficulty in naming a bird so brilliantly and
distinctly marked as this green, gold, and black warbler, that lifts
up a few pure, sweet, tender notes, loud enough to attract attention
when he visits the garden. "<i>See-see, see-saw</i>," he sings, but there
is a tone of anxiety betrayed in the simple, sylvan strain that always
seems as if the bird needed reassuring, possibly due to the rising
inflection, like an interrogative, of the last notes.</p>

<p>However abundant about our homes during the migrations, this warbler,
true to the family instinct, retreats to the woods to nest&mdash;not always
so far away as Canada, the nesting ground of most warblers, for in
many Northern States the bird is commonly found throughout the summer.
Doubtless it prefers tall evergreen trees for its mossy, grassy nest;
but it is not always particular, so that the tree be a tall one with a
convenient fork in an upper branch.</p>

<p>Early in September increased numbers emerge from the woods, the
plumage of the male being less brilliant than when we saw it last, as
if the family cares of the summer had proved too taxing. For nearly a
month longer they hunt incessantly, with much flitting about the
leaves and twigs at the ends of branches in the shrubbery and
evergreens, for the tiny insects that the warblers must devour by the
million during their all too brief visit.</p>

<p>This is undoubtedly the beauty of the vireo family&mdash;a group of neat,
active, stoutly built, and vigorous little birds of yellow, greenish,
and white plumage; birds that love the trees, and whose feathers
reflect the coloring of the leaves they hide, hunt, and nest among.
"We have no birds," says Bradford Torrey, "so unsparing of their
music: they sing from morning till night."</p>

<p>The yellow-throated vireo partakes of all the family characteristics,
but, in addition to these, it eclipses all its relatives in the
brilliancy of its coloring and in the art of nest-building, which it
has brought to a state of hopeless perfection. No envious bird need
try to excel the exquisite finish of its workmanship. Happily, it has
wit enough to build its pensile nest high above the reach of small
boys, usually suspending it from a branch overhanging running water
that threatens too precipitous a bath to tempt the young climbers.</p>

<p>However common in the city parks and suburban gardens this bird may be
during the migrations, it delights in a secluded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg_190]</a></span>
retreat overgrown with tall trees and near a stream, such as is dear
to the solitary vireo as well when the nesting time approaches. High
up in the trees we hear its rather sad, persistent strain, that is
more in harmony with the dim forest than with the gay flower garden,
where, if the truth must be told, its song is both monotonous and
depressing. Mr. Bicknell says it is the only vireo that sings as it
flies.</p>

<p>An old field, overgrown with thistles and tall, stalky wild flowers,
is the paradise of the goldfinches, summer or winter. Here they
congregate in happy companies while the sunshine and goldenrod are as
bright as their feathers, and cling to the swaying slender stems that
furnish an abundant harvest, daintily lunching upon the fluffy seeds
of thistle blossoms, pecking at the mullein-stalks, and swinging
airily among the asters and Michaelmas daisies; or, when snow covers
the same field with a glistening crust, above which the brown stalks
offer only a meagre dinner, the same birds, now sombrely clad in
winter feathers, cling to the swaying stems with cheerful fortitude.</p>

<p>At your approach, the busy company rises on the wing, and with
peculiar, wavy flight rise and fall through the air, marking each
undulation with a cluster of notes, sweet and clear, that come
floating downward from the blue ether, where the birds seem to bound
along exultant in their motion and song alike.</p>

<p>In the spring the plumage of the goldfinch, which has been drab and
brown through the winter months, is moulted or shed&mdash;a change that
transforms the bird from a sombre Puritan into the gayest of
cavaliers, and seems to wonderfully exalt his spirits. He bursts into
a wild, sweet, incoherent melody that might be the outpouring from two
or three throats at once instead of one, expressing his rapture
somewhat after the manner of the canary, although his song lacks the
variety and the finish of his caged namesake. What tone of sadness in
his music the man found who applied the adjective <i>tristis</i> to his
scientific name it is difficult to imagine when listening to the notes
that come bubbling up from the bird's happy heart.</p>

<p>With plumage so lovely and song so delicious and dreamy, it is small
wonder that numbers of our goldfinches are caught and caged, however
inferior their song may be to the European species recently introduced
into this country. Heard in Central Park, New York, where they were
set at liberty, the European goldfinches seemed to sing with more
abandon, perhaps, but with no more sweetness than their American
cousins. The song remains at its best all through the summer months,
for the bird is a long wooer. It is nearly July before he mates, and
not until the tardy cedar birds are house-building in the orchard do
the happy pair begin to carry grass, moss, and plant-down to a crotch
of some tall tree convenient to a field of such wild flowers as will
furnish food to a growing family. Doubtless the birds wait for this
food to be in proper condition before they undertake parental duties
at all&mdash;the most plausible excuse for their late nesting. The cares
evolving from four to six pale-blue eggs will suffice to quiet the
father's song for the winter by the first of September, and fade all
the glory out of his shining coat. As pretty a sight as any garden
offers is when a family of goldfinches alights on the top of a
sunflower to feast upon the oily seeds&mdash;a perfect harmony of brown and
gold.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Range</i>&mdash;Interior of North America. Resident from Manitoba
northward. Common winter visitor in northwestern United States
and Mississippi Valley; casual winter visitor in northern
Atlantic States.</div>

<p>In the winter of 1889-90 Eastern people had the rare treat of becoming
acquainted with this common bird of the Northwest, that, in one of its
erratic travels, chose to visit New England and the Atlantic States,
as far south as Delaware, in great numbers. Those who saw the evening
grosbeaks then remember how beautiful their yellow plumage&mdash;a rare
winter tint&mdash;looked in the snow-covered trees, where small companies
of the gentle and even tame visitors enjoyed the buds and seeds of the
maples, elders, and evergreens. Possibly evening grosbeaks were in
vogue for the next season's millinery, or perhaps Eastern
ornithologists had a sudden zeal to investigate their structural
anatomy. At any rate, these birds, whose very tameness, that showed
slight acquaintance with mankind, should have touched the coldest
heart, received the warmest kind of a reception from hot shot. The few
birds that escaped to the solitudes of Manitoba could not be expected
to tempt other travellers eastward by an account of their visit. The
bird is quite likely to remain rare in the East.</p>

<p>But in the Mississippi Valley and throughout the northwest, companies
of from six to sixty may be regularly counted upon as winter neighbors
on almost every farm. Here the females keep up a busy chatting, like a
company of cedar birds, and the males punctuate their pauses with a
single shrill note that gives little indication of their vocal powers.
But in the solitude of the northern forests the love-song is said to
resemble the robin's at the start. Unhappily, after a most promising
beginning, the bird suddenly stops, as if he were out of breath.</p>

<p>In the naming of warblers, bluish slate is the shade intended when
blue is mentioned; so that if you see a dainty little olive and yellow
bird with slate-colored wings and tail hunting for spiders in the
blossoming orchard or during the early autumn you will have seen the
beautiful blue-winged warbler. It has a rather leisurely way of
hunting, unlike the nervous, restless flitting about from twig to twig
that is characteristic of many of its many cousins. The search is
thorough&mdash;bark, stems, blossoms, leaves are inspected for larv&#230; and
spiders, with many pretty motions of head and body. Sometimes, hanging
with head downward, the bird suggests a yellow titmouse. After blossom
time a pair of these warblers, that have done serviceable work in the
orchard in their all too brief stay, hurry off to dense woods to nest.
They are usually to be seen in pairs at all seasons. Not to "high
coniferous trees in northern forests"&mdash;the Mecca of innumerable
warblers&mdash;but to scrubby, second growth of woodland borders, or lower
trees in the heart of the woods, do these dainty birds retreat. There
they build the usual warbler nest of twigs, bits of bark, leaves, and
grasses, but with this peculiarity: the numerous leaves with which the
nest is wrapped all have their stems pointing upward. Mr. Frank
Chapman has admirably defined their song as consisting of "two
drawled, wheezy notes&mdash;<i>swee-chee</i>, the first inhaled, the second
exhaled."</p>

<p>Since about one-third of all the song-birds met with in a year's
rambles are apt to be warblers, the novice cannot devote his first
attention to a better group, confusing though it is by reason of its
size and the repetition of the same colors in so many bewildering
combinations. Monotony, however, is unknown in the warbler family.
Whoever can rightly name every warbler, male and female, on sight is
uniquely accomplished.</p>

<p>The jet necklace worn on this bird's breast is its best mark of
identification. Its form is particularly slender and graceful, as
might be expected in a bird so active, one to whom a hundred tiny
insects barely afford a dinner that must often be caught piecemeal as
it flies past. To satisfy its appetite, which cannot but be dainty in
so thoroughly charming a bird, it lives in low, boggy woods, in such
retreats as Wilson's black-capped warbler selects for a like reason.
Neither of these two "flycatcher" warblers depends altogether on
catching insects on the wing; countless thousands are picked off the
under sides of leaves and about the stems of twigs in true warbler
fashion.</p>

<p>The Canadian's song is particularly loud, sweet, and vivacious. It is
hazardous for any one without long field practice to try to name any
warbler by its song alone, but possibly this one's animated music is
as characteristic as any.</p>

<p>The nest is built on the ground on a mossy bank or elevated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg_195]</a></span>
into the root crannies of some large tree, where there is much water
in the woods. Bits of bark, dead wood, moss, and fine rootlets, all
carefully wrapped with leaves, go to make the pretty cradle.
Unhappily, the little Canada warblers are often cheated out of their
natural rights, like so many other delightful song-birds, by the
greedy interloper that the cowbird deposits in their nest.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>Male</i>&mdash;Head, neck, chin, and throat black like a hood in

<p>This beautifully marked, sprightly little warbler might be mistaken in
his immaturity for the yellowthroat; and as it is said to take him
nearly three years to grow his hood, with the completed cowl and cape,
there is surely sufficient reason here for the despair that often
seizes the novice in attempting to distinguish the perplexing
warblers. Like its Southern counterpart, the hooded warbler prefers
wet woods and low trees rather than high ones, for much of its food
consists of insects attracted by the dampness, and many of them must
be taken on the wing. Because of its tireless activity the bird's
figure is particularly slender and graceful&mdash;a trait, too, to which we
owe all the glimpses of it we are likely to get throughout the summer.
It has a curious habit of spreading its tail, as if it wished you to
take special notice of the white spots that adorn it; not flirting it,
as the redstart does his more gorgeous one, but simply opening it like
a fan as it flies and darts about.</p>

<p>Its song, which is particularly sweet and graceful and with

<p>No bird is common at the extreme limits of its range, and so this
warbler has a reputation for rarity among the New England
ornithologists that would surprise people in the middle South and
Southwest. After all that may be said in the books, a bird is either
common or rare to the individual who may or may not have happened to
become acquainted with it in any part of its chosen territory. Plenty
of people in Kentucky, where we might judge from its name this bird is
supposed to be most numerous, have never seen or heard of it, while a
student on the Hudson River, within sight of New York, knows it
intimately. It also nests regularly in certain parts of the
Connecticut Valley. "Who is my neighbor?" is often a question
difficult indeed to answer where birds are concerned. In the chapter,
"Spring at the Capital," which, with every reading of "Wake Robin,"
inspires the bird-lover with fresh zeal, Mr. Burroughs writes of the
Kentucky warbler: "I meet with him in low, damp places, in the woods,
usually on the steep sides of some little run. I hear at intervals a
clear, strong, bell-like whistle or warble, and presently catch a
glimpse of the bird as he jumps up from the ground to take an insect
or worm from the under side of a leaf. This is his characteristic
movement. He belongs to the class of ground warblers, and his range is
very low, indeed lower than that of any other species with which I am
acquainted."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg_197]</a></span>
Like the ovenbird and comparatively few others, for most
birds hop over the ground, the Kentucky warbler <i>walks</i> rapidly about,
looking for insects under the fallen leaves, and poking his
inquisitive beak into every cranny where a spider may be lurking. The
bird has a pretty, conscious way of flying up to a perch, a few feet
above the ground, as a tenor might advance towards the footlights of a
stage, to pour forth his clear, penetrating whistle, that in the
nesting season especially is repeated over and over again with
tireless persistency.</p>

<p>In spite of the bird's name, one need not look for it in the glossy
magnolia trees of the southern gardens more than in the shrubbery on
New England lawns, and during the migrations it is quite as likely to
be found in one place as in the other. Its true preference, however,
is for the spruces and hemlocks of its nesting ground in the northern
forests. For these it deserts us after a brief hunt about the tender,
young spring foliage and blossoms, where the early worm lies
concealed, and before we have become so well acquainted with its
handsome clothes that we will instantly recognize it in the duller
ones it wears on its return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg_198]</a></span>
trip in the autumn. The position of the white marks on the tail
feathers of this warbler, however, is the clue by which it may be
identified at any season or any stage of its growth. If the white bar
runs across the <i>middle</i> of the warbler's tail, you can be sure of the
identity of the bird. A nervous and restless hunter, it nevertheless
seems less shy than many of its kin. Another pleasing characteristic
is that it brings back with it in October the loud, clear, rapid
whistle with which it has entertained its nesting mate in the Canada

<p>Since Audubon met with but one of these birds in his incessant
trampings, and Wilson secured only an immature, imperfectly marked
specimen for his collection, the novice may feel no disappointment if
he fails to make the acquaintance of this "gay and agreeable widow."
And yet the shy and wary bird is not unknown in Central Park, New York
City. Even where its clear, whistled song strikes the ear with a
startling novelty that invites to instant pursuit of the singer, you
may look long and diligently through the undergrowth without finding
it. Dr. Merriam says the whistle resembles the syllables "<i>true, true,
true, tru, too</i>, the voice rising on the first three syllables and
falling on the last two." In the nesting season this song is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg_199]</a></span>
repeated over and over again with a persistency worthy of a Kentucky

<p>It must not be thought that this beautiful warbler confines itself to
backyards in the city of Nashville simply because Wilson discovered it
near there and gave it a local name, for the bird's actual range
reaches from the fur trader's camp near Hudson Bay to the adobe
villages of Mexico and Central America, and over two thousand miles
east and west in the United States. It chooses open rather than dense
woods and tree-bordered fields. It seems to have a liking for hemlocks
and pine trees, especially if near a stream that attracts insects to
its shores; and Dr. Warren notes that in Pennsylvania he finds small
flocks of these warblers in the autumn migration, feeding in the
willow trees near little rivers and ponds. Only in the northern parts
of the United States is their nest ever found, for the northern
British provinces are their preferred nesting ground. One seen in the
White Mountains was built on a mossy, rocky ledge, directly on the
ground at the foot of a pine tree, and made of rootlets, moss, needles
from the trees overhead, and several layers of leaves outside, with a
lining of fine grasses that cradled four white, speckled eggs.</p>

<p>Audubon likened the bird's feeble note to the breaking of twigs.</p>

<p>The pine warbler closely presses the myrtle warbler for the first
place in the ranks of the family migrants, but as the latter bird
often stays north all winter, it is usually given the palm. Here is a
warbler, let it be recorded, that is fittingly named, for it is a
denizen of pine woods only; most common in the long stretches of pine
forests at the south and in New York and New England, and
correspondingly uncommon wherever the woods-man's axe has laid the
pine trees low throughout its range. Its "simple, sweet, and drowsy
song," writes Mr. Parkhurst, is always associated "with the smell of
pines on a sultry day." It recalls that of the junco and the social
sparrow or chippy.</p>

<p>Creeping over the bark of trees and peering into every crevice like a
nuthatch; running along the limbs, not often hopping nervously or
flitting like the warblers; darting into the air for a passing insect,
or descending to the ground to feed on seeds and berries, the pine
warbler has, by a curious combination, the movements that seem to
characterize several different birds.</p>

<p>It is one of the largest and hardiest members of its family, but not
remarkable for its beauty. It is a sociable traveller, cheerfully
escorting other warblers northward, and welcoming to its band both the
yellow redpolls and the myrtle warblers. These birds are very often
seen together in the pine and other evergreen trees in our lawns and
in the large city parks.</p>

<p>Doubtless this diminutive bird was given its name because it prefers
open country rather than the woods&mdash;the scrubby undergrowth of oaks,
young evergreens, and bushes that border clearings being as good a
place as any to look for it, and not the wind-swept, treeless tracts
of the wild West. Its range is southerly. The Southern and Middle
States are where it is most abundant. Here is a wood warbler that is
not a bird of the woods&mdash;less so, in fact, than either the summer
yellowbird (yellow warbler) or the palm warbler, that are eminently
neighborly and fond of pasture lands and roadside thickets. But the
prairie warblers are rather more retiring little sprites than their
cousins, and it is not often we get a close enough view of them to
note the brick-red spots on their backs, which are their
distinguishing marks. They have a most unkind preference for briery
bushes, that discourage human intimacy. In such forbidding retreats
they build their nest of plant-fibre, rootlets, and twigs, lined with
plant-down and hair.</p>

<p>The song of an individual prairie warbler makes only a slight
impression. It consists "of a series of six or seven quickly repeated
<i>zees</i> the next to the last one being the highest" (Chapman). But the
united voices of a dozen or more of these pretty little birds, that
often sing together, afford something approaching a musical treat.</p>

<p>To see this strikingly marked little bird one must be on the sharp
lookout for it during the latter half of May, or at the season of
apple bloom, and the early part of September. It passes northward with
an almost scornful rapidity. Audubon mentions having seen it in Maine
at the end of October, but this specimen surely must have been an
exceptional laggard.</p>

<p>In common with several others of its family, it is exceedingly expert
in catching insects on the wing; but it may be known as no true
flycatcher from the conspicuous rich yellow of its under parts, and
also from its habit of returning from a midair sally to a different
perch from the one it left to pursue its dinner. A true flycatcher
usually returns to its old perch after each hunt.</p>

<p>To indulge in this a&#235;rial chase with success, these warblers select
for their home and hunting ground some low woodland growth where a
sluggish stream attracts myriads of insects to the boggy neighborhood.
Here they build their nest in low bushes or upon the ground. Four or
five grayish eggs, sprinkled with cinnamon-colored spots in a circle
around the larger end, are laid in the grassy cradle in June. Mr. H.
D. Minot found one of these nests on Pike's Peak at an altitude of
11,000 feet, almost at the limit of vegetation. The same authority
compares the bird's song to that of the redstart and the yellow
warbler.</p>

<p>While the uniform yellow of this warbler's under parts in any plumage
is its distinguishing mark, it also has a flycatcher's trait of
constantly flirting its tail, that is at once an outlet for its
superabundant vivacity and a fairly reliable aid to identification.
The tail is jerked, wagged, and flirted like a baton in the hands of
an inexperienced leader of an orchestra. One need not go to the woods
to look for the restless little sprite that comes northward when the
early April foliage is as yellow and green as its feathers. It prefers
the fields and roadsides, and before there are leaves enough on the
undergrowth to conceal it we may come to know it as well as it is
possible to know any bird whose home life is passed so far away.
Usually it is the first warbler one sees in the spring in New York and
New England. With all the alertness of a flycatcher, it will dart into
the air after insects that fly near the ground, keeping up a constant
<i>chip, chip</i>, fine and shrill, at one end of the small body, and the
liveliest sort of tail motions at the other. The pine warbler often
bears it company.</p>

<p>With the first suspicion of warm weather, off goes this hardy little
fellow that apparently loves the cold almost well enough to stay north
all the year like its cousin, the myrtle warbler. It builds a
particularly deep nest, of the usual warbler construction, on the
ground, but its eggs are rosy rather than the bluish white of others.</p>

<p>In the Southern States the bird becomes particularly neighborly,

<p>This exquisite little creature of perpetual summer (though to find it
it must travel back and forth between two continents) comes out of the
south with the golden days of spring. From much living in the sunshine
through countless generations, its feathers have finally become the
color of sunshine itself, and in disposition, as well, it is nothing
if not sunny and bright. Not the least of its attractions is that it
is exceedingly common everywhere: in the shrubbery of our lawns, in
gardens and orchards, by the road and brookside, in the edges of
woods&mdash;everywhere we catch its glint of brightness through the long
summer days, and hear its simple, sweet, and happy song until the end
of July.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg_205]</a></span>
Because both birds are so conspicuously yellow, no doubt
this warbler is quite generally confused with the goldfinch; but their
distinctions are clear enough to any but the most superficial glance.
In the first place, the yellow warbler is a smaller bird than the
goldfinch; it has neither black crown, wings, nor tail, and it does
have reddish-brown streaks on its breast that are sufficiently
obsolete to make the coloring of that part look simply dull at a
little distance. The goldfinch's bill is heavy, in order that it may
crack seeds, whereas the yellow warbler's is slender, to enable it to
pick minute insects from the foliage. The goldfinch's wavy, curved
flight is unique, and that of his "double" differs not a whit from
that of all nervous, flitting warblers. Surely no one familiar with
the rich, full, canary-like song of the "wild canary," as the
goldfinch is called, could confuse it with the mild "<i>Wee-chee, chee,
cher-wee</i>" of the summer yellowbird. Another distinction, not always
infallible, but nearly so, is that when seen feeding, the goldfinch is
generally below the line of vision, while the yellow warbler is either
on it or not far above it, as it rarely goes over twelve feet from the
ground.</p>

<p>No doubt, the particularly mild, sweet amiability of the yellow
warbler is responsible for the persistent visitations of the cowbird,
from which it is a conspicuous sufferer. In the exquisite, neat little
matted cradle of glistening milkweed flax, lined with down from the
fronds of fern, the skulking housebreaker deposits her surreptitious
egg for the little yellow mother-bird to hatch and tend. But
amiability is not the only prominent trait in the female yellow
warbler's character. She is clever as well, and quickly builds a new
bottom on her nest, thus sealing up the cowbird's egg, and depositing
her own on the soft, spongy floor above it. This operation has been
known to be twice repeated, until the nest became three stories high,
when a persistent cowbird made such unusual architecture necessary.</p>

<p>The most common nesting place of the yellow warbler is in low willows
along the shores of streams.</p>

<p>This largest of the warblers might be mistaken for a dozen birds
collectively in as many minutes; but when it is known that the jumble
of whistles, parts of songs, chuckles, clucks, barks, quacks, whines,
and wails proceed from a single throat, the yellow-breasted chat
becomes a marked specimen forthwith&mdash;a conspicuous individual never to
be confused with any other member of the feathered tribe. It is indeed
absolutely unique. The catbird and the mocking-bird are rare mimics;
but while the chat is not their equal in this respect, it has a large
repertoire of weird, uncanny cries all its own&mdash;a power of throwing
its voice, like a human ventriloquist, into unexpected corners of the
thicket or meadow. In addition to its extraordinary vocal feats, it
can turn somersaults and do other clown-like stunts as well as any
variety actor on the Bowery stage.</p>

<p>Only by creeping cautiously towards the roadside tangle, where this
"rollicking polyglot" is entertaining himself and his mate, brooding
over her speckled eggs in a bulky nest set in a most inaccessible
briery part of the thicket, can you hope to hear him rattle through
his variety performance. Walk boldly or noisily past his retreat, and
there is "silence there and nothing more." But two very bright eyes
peer out at you through the undergrowth, where the trim,
elegant-looking bird watches you with quizzical suspicion until you
quietly seat yourself and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg_207]</a></span>
assume silent indifference. "<i>Whew, whew!</i>" he begins, and then
immediately, with evident intent to amuse, he rattles off an
indescribable, eccentric medley until your ears are tired listening.
With bill uplifted, tail drooping, wings fluttering at his side, he
cuts an absurd figure enough, but not so comical as when he rises into
the air, trailing his legs behind him stork-fashion. This surely is
the clown among birds. But any though he is, he is as capable of
devotion to his Columbine as Punchinello, and remains faithfully mated
year after year. However much of a tease and a deceiver he may be to
the passer-by along the roadside, in the privacy of the domestic
circle he shows truly lovable traits.</p>

<p>He has the habit of singing in his unmusical way on moonlight nights.
Probably his ventriloquial powers are cultivated not for popular
entertainment, but to lure intruders away from his nest.</p>

<p>"Given a piece of marshy ground with an abundance of skunk cabbage and
a fairly dense growth of saplings, and near by a tangle of green brier
and blackberry, and you will be pretty sure to have it tenanted by a
pair of yellowthroats," says Dr. Abbott, who found several of their
nests in skunk-cabbage plants, which he says are favorite cradles. No
animal cares to touch this plant if it can be avoided; but have the
birds themselves no sense of smell?</p>

Before and after the nesting season these active birds, plump of form,
elegant of attire, forceful, but not bold, enter the scrubby pastures
near our houses and the shrubbery of old-fashioned, overgrown gardens,
and peer out at the human wanderer therein with a charming curiosity.
The bright eyes of the male masquerader shine through his black mask,
where he intently watches you from the tangle of syringa and snowball
bushes; and as he flies into the laburnum with its golden chain of
blossoms that pale before the yellow of his throat and breast, you are
so impressed with his grace and elegance that you follow too
audaciously, he thinks, and off he goes. And yet this is a bird that
seems to delight in being pursued. It never goes so far away that you
are not tempted to follow it, though it be through dense undergrowth
and swampy thickets, and it always gives you just glimpse enough of
its beauties and graces before it flies ahead, to invite the hope of a
closer inspection next time. When it dives into the deepest part of
the tangle, where you can imagine it hunting about among the roots and
fallen leaves for the larv&#230;, caterpillars, spiders, and other
insects on which it feeds, it sometimes amuses itself with a simple
little song between the hunts. But the bird's indifference, you feel
sure, arises from preoccupation rather than rudeness.</p>

<p>If, however, your visit to the undergrowth is unfortunately timed and
there happens to be a bulky nest in process of construction on the
ground, a quickly repeated, vigorous <i>chit, pit, quit</i>, impatiently
inquires the reason for your bold intrusion. Withdraw discreetly and
listen to the love-song that is presently poured out to reassure his
plain little maskless mate. The music is delivered with all the force
and energy of his vigorous nature and penetrates to a surprising
distance. "<i>Follow me, follow me, follow me</i>," many people hear him
say; others write the syllables, "<i>Wichity, wichity, wichity,
wichity</i>"; and still others write them, "<i>I beseech you, I beseech
you, I beseech you</i>," though the tones of this self-assertive bird
rather command than entreat. Mr. Frank Chapman says of the
yellowthroats: "They sing throughout the summer, and in August add a
flight-song to their repertoire. This is usually uttered toward
evening, when the bird springs several feet into the air, hovers for a
second, and then drops back to the bushes."</p>

<p>"The orange-throated warbler would seem to be his right name, his
characteristic cognomen," says John Burroughs, in ever-delightful
"Wake Robin"; "but no, he is doomed to wear the name of some
discoverer, perhaps the first who robbed his nest or rifled him of his
mate&mdash;Blackburn; hence, Blackburnian warbler. The <i>burn</i> seems
appropriate enough, for in these dark evergreens his throat and breast
show like flame. He has a very fine warble, suggesting that of the
redstart, but not especially musical."</p>

<p>No foliage is dense enough to hide, and no autumnal tint too brilliant
to outshine this luminous little bird that in May, as it migrates
northward to its nesting ground, darts in and out of the leafy shadows
like a tongue of fire.</p>

<p>It is by far the most glorious of all the warblers&mdash;a sort of
diminutive oriole. The quiet-colored little mate flits about after
him, apparently lost in admiration of his fine feathers and the ease
with which his thin tenor voice can end his lover's warble in a high Z.</p>

<p>Take a good look at this attractive couple, for in May they leave us
to build a nest of bark and moss in the evergreens of Canada&mdash;that
paradise for warblers&mdash;or of the Catskills and Adirondacks, and in
autumn they hurry south to escape the first frosts.</p>

<p>Late some evening, early in May, when one by one the birds have
withdrawn their voices from the vesper chorus, listen for the
lingering "<i>'tsee, 'tsee, 'tseet</i>" (usually twelve times repeated in a
minute), that the redstart sweetly but rather monotonously sings from
the evergreens, where, as his tiny body burns in the twilight, Mrs.
Wright likens him to a "wind-blown firebrand, half glowing, half
charred."</p>

<p>But by daylight this brilliant little warbler is constantly on the
alert. It is true he has the habit, like the flycatchers (among which
some learned ornithologists still class him), of sitting pensively on
a branch, with fluffy feathers and drooping wings; but the very next
instant he shows true warbler blood by making a sudden dash upward,
then downward through the air, tumbling somersaults, as if blown by
the wind, flitting from branch to branch, busily snapping at the tiny
insects hidden beneath the leaves, clinging to the tree-trunk like a
creeper, and singing between bites.</p>

<p>Possibly he will stop long enough in his mad chase to open and shut
his tail, fan-fashion, with a dainty egotism that, in the peacock,
becomes rank vanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg_211]</a></span>
The Germans call this little bird <i>roth Stert</i> (red tail), but, like
so many popular names, this is a misnomer, as, strictly speaking, the
redstart is never red, though its salmon-orange markings often border
on to orange-flame.</p>

<p>In a fork of some tall bush or tree, placed ten or fifteen feet from
the ground, a carefully constructed little nest is made of moss,
horsehair, and strippings from the bark, against which the nest is
built, the better to conceal its location. Four or five whitish eggs,
thickly sprinkled with pale brown and lilac, like the other warblers',
are too jealously guarded by the little mother-bird to be very often
seen.</p>

<p>A flash of fire through the air; a rich, high, whistled song floating
in the wake of the feathered meteor: the Baltimore oriole cannot be
mistaken. When the orchards are in blossom he arrives in full plumage
and song, and awaits the coming of the female birds, that travel
northward more leisurely in flocks. He is decidedly in evidence. No
foliage is dense enough to hide his brilliancy; his temper, quite as
fiery as his feathers, leads him into noisy quarrels, and his
insistent song with its martial, interrogative notes becomes almost
tiresome until he is happily mated and family cares check his
enthusiasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg_212]</a></span>
Among the best architects in the world is his plain but
energetic mate. Gracefully swung from a high branch of some tall tree,
the nest is woven with exquisite skill into a long, flexible pouch
that rain cannot penetrate, nor wind shake from its horsehair
moorings. Bits of string, threads of silk, and sometimes yarn of the
gayest colors, if laid about the shrubbery in the garden, will be
quickly interwoven with the shreds of bark and milkweed stalks that
the bird has found afield. The shape of the nest often differs,
because in unsettled regions, where hawks abound, it is necessary to
make it deeper than seven inches (the customary depth when it is built
near the homes of men), and to partly close it at the top to conceal
the sitting bird. From four to six whitish eggs, scrawled over with
black-brown, are hatched by the mother oriole, and most jealously
guarded by her now truly domesticated mate.</p>

<p>The number of grubs, worms, flies, caterpillars, and even cocoons,
that go to satisfy the hunger of a family of orioles in a day, might
indicate, if it could be computed, the great value these birds are
about our homes, aside from the good cheer they bring.</p>

<p>There is a popular tradition about the naming of this gorgeous bird:
When George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore, worn out and
discouraged by various hardships in his Newfoundland colony, decided
to visit Virginia in 1628, he wrote that nothing in the Chesapeake
country so impressed him as the myriads of birds in its woods. But the
song and color of the oriole particularly cheered and delighted him,
and orange and black became the heraldic colors of the first lords
proprietors of Maryland.</p>

<p>Among the numerous names by which this beautiful bird is known, it has
become immortalized under the title of Mr. James Lane Allen's
exquisite book, "The Kentucky Cardinal." Here, while we are given a
most charmingly sympathetic, delicate account of the bird "who has
only to be seen or heard, and Death adjusts an arrow," it is the
cardinal's pathetic fate that impresses one most. Seen through less
poetical eyes, however, the bird appears to be a haughty autocrat, a
sort of "F. F. V." among the feathered tribes, as, indeed, his title,
"Virginia redbird," has been unkindly said to imply. Bearing himself
with a refined and courtly dignity, not stooping to soil his feet by
walking on the ground like the more democratic robin, or even
condescending below the level of the laurel bushes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg_216]</a></span>
the cardinal is literally a shining example of self-conscious
superiority&mdash;a bird to call forth respect and admiration rather
than affection. But a group of cardinals in a cedar tree in a snowy
winter landscape makes us forgetful of everything but their supreme
beauty.</p>

<p>As might be expected in one of the finch family, the cardinal is a
songster&mdash;the fact which, in connection with his lovely plumage,
accounts for the number of these birds shipped in cages to Europe,
where they are known as Virginia nightingales. Commencing with a
strong, rich whistle, like the high notes of a fife,
"<i>Cheo-cheo-cheo-cheo</i>," repeated over and over as if to make perfect
the start of a song he is about to sing, suddenly he stops, and you
learn that there is to be no glorious performance after all, only a
prelude to&mdash;nothing. The song, such as it is, begins, with both male
and female, in March, and lasts, with a brief intermission, until
September&mdash;"the most melodious sigh," as Mr. Allen calls it. Early in
May the cardinals build a bulky and loosely made nest, usually in the
holly, laurel, or other evergreen shrubs that they always love to
frequent, especially if these are near fields of corn or other grain.
And often two broods in a year come forth from the pale-gray,
brown-marked eggs, bearing what is literally for them the "fatal gift
of beauty."</p>

<p>Thirty years ago, it is recorded that so far north as New Jersey the
summer redbird was quite as common as any of the thrushes. In the
South still there is scarcely an orchard that does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg_217]</a></span>
not contain this tropical-looking beauty&mdash;the redbird <i>par
excellence</i>, the sweetest singer of the family. Is there a more
beautiful sight in all nature than a grove of orange trees laden with
fruit, starred with their delicious blossoms, and with flocks of
redbirds disporting themselves among the dark, glossy leaves? Pine and
oak woods are also favorite resorts, especially at the north, where
the bird nowadays forsakes the orchards to hide his beauty, if he can,
unharmed by the rifle that only rarely is offered so shining a mark.
He shows the scarlet tanager's preference for tree-tops, where his
musical voice, calling "<i>Chicky-tucky-tuk</i>," alone betrays his
presence in the woods. The Southern farmers declare that he is an
infallible weather prophet, his "<i>WET, WET, WET</i>," being the certain
indication of rain&mdash;another absurd saw, for the call-note is by
no means confined to the rainy season.</p>

<p>The yellowish-olive mate, whose quiet colors betray no nest secrets,
collects twigs and grasses for the cradle to be saddled on the end of
some horizontal branch, though in this work the male sometimes
cautiously takes an insignificant part. After her three or four eggs
are laid she sits upon them for nearly two weeks, being only rarely
and stealthily visited by her mate with some choice grub, blossom, or
berry in his beak. But how cheerfully his fife-like whistle rings out
during the temporary exile! Then his song is at its best. Later in the
summer he has an aggravating way of joining in the chorus of other
birds' songs, by which the pleasant individuality of his own voice is
lost.</p>

<p>A nest of these tanagers, observed not far from New York City, was
commenced the last week of May on the extreme edge of a hickory limb
in an open wood; four eggs were laid on the fourth of June, and twelve
days later the tiny fledglings, that all look like their mother in the
early stages of their existence, burst from the greenish-white,
speckled shells. In less than a month the young birds were able to fly
quite well and collect their food.</p>

<p>The gorgeous coloring of the scarlet tanager has been its snare and
destruction. The densest evergreens could not altogether hide this
blazing target for the sportsman's gun, too often fired at the
instigation of city milliners. "Fine feathers make fine birds"&mdash;and
cruel, silly women, the adage might be adapted for latter-day use.
This rarely beautiful tanager, thanks to them, is now only an
infrequent flash of beauty in our country roads.</p>

<p>Instinct leads it to be chary of its charms; and whereas it used to be
one of the commonest of bird neighbors, it is now shy and solitary. An
ideal resort for it is a grove of oak or swamp maple near a stream or
pond where it can bathe. Evergreen trees, too, are favorites, possibly
because the bird knows how exquisitely its bright scarlet coat is set
off by their dark background.</p>

<p>High in the tree-tops he perches, all unsuspected by the visitor
passing through the woods below, until a burst of rich, sweet melody
directs the opera-glasses suddenly upward. There we detect him
carolling loud and cheerfully, like a robin. He is an apparition of
beauty&mdash;a veritable bird of paradise, as, indeed, he is sometimes
called. Because of their similar coloring, the tanager and cardinal
are sometimes confounded, but an instant's comparison of the two birds
shows nothing in common except red feathers, and even those of quite
different shades. The inconspicuous olive-green and yellow of the
female tanager's plumage is another striking instance of Nature's
unequal distribution of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg_219]</a></span>
gifts; but if our bright-colored birds have become shockingly few
under existing conditions, would any at all remain were the females
prominent, like the males, as they brood upon the nest? Both tanagers
construct a rather disorderly-looking nest of fibres and sticks,
through which daylight can be seen where it rests securely upon the
horizontal branch of some oak or pine tree; but as soon as three or
four bluish-green eggs have been laid in the cradle, off goes the
father, wearing his tell-tale coat, to a distant tree. There he sings
his sweetest carol to the patient, brooding mate, returning to her
side only long enough to feed her with the insects and berries that
form their food.</p>

<p>Happily for the young birds' fate, they are clothed at first in
motley, dull colors, with here and there only a bright touch of

gorgeous plumage must be their admiration. But after the moulting
season it would be a wise tanager that knew its own father.
His scarlet feathers are now replaced by an autumn coat of olive
and yellow not unlike his mate's.</p>

them charming prominence; but they also feed freely upon the buds of
various deciduous trees.</p>

<p>South of Canada we may not look for them except in the severest winter
weather. Even then their coming is not to be positively depended upon;
but when their caprice&mdash;or was it an unusually fierce northern
blast?&mdash;sends them over the Canada border, it is a simple matter to
identify them when such brilliant birds are rare. The brownish-yellow
and grayish females and young males, however, always seem to be in the
majority with us, though our Canadian friends assure us of the
irreproachable morals of this gay bird.</p>

<p>Wherever there are clusters of pine or cedar trees, when there is a
flock of pine grosbeaks in the neighborhood, you may expect to find a
pair of birds diligently feeding upon the seeds and berries. No
cheerful note escapes them as they persistently gormandize, and, if
the truth must be confessed, they appear to be rather stupid and
uninteresting, albeit they visit us at a time when we are most
inclined to rapture over our bird visitors. They are said to have a
deliciously sweet song in the nesting season. When, however, few
except the Canadian <i>voyageurs</i> hear it.</p>

<p>It is a rash statement to say that a bird is rare simply because you
have never seen it in your neighborhood, for while you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg_221]</a></span>
going out of the front door your <i>rara avis</i> may be eating the crumbs
about your kitchen. Even with our eyes and ears constantly alert for
some fresh bird excitement, our phlegmatic neighbor over the way may
be enjoying a visit from a whole flock of the very bird we have been
looking and listening for in vain all the year. The red crossbills are
capricious little visitors, it is true, but by no means uncommon.</p>

<p>About the size of an English sparrow, of a brick or Indian red color,
for the most part, the peculiarity of its parrot-like beak is its
certain mark of identification.</p>

<p>Longfellow has rendered into verse the German legend of the crossbill,
which tells that as the Saviour hung upon the cross, a little bird
tried to pull out the nails that pierced His hands and feet, thus
twisting its beak and staining its feathers with the blood.</p>

<p>At first glance the birds would seem to be hampered by their crossed
beaks in getting at the seeds in the pine cones&mdash;a superficial
criticism when the thoroughness and admirable dexterity of their work
are better understood.</p>

<p>Various seeds of fruits, berries, and the buds of trees enlarge their
bill of fare. They are said to be inordinately fond of salt. Mr.
Romeyn B. Hough tells of a certain old ice-cream freezer that
attracted flocks of crossbills one winter, as a salt-lick attracts
deer. Whether the traditional salt that may have stuck to the bird's
tail is responsible for its tameness is not related, but it is certain
the crossbills, like most bird visitors from the far north, are
remarkably gentle, friendly little birds. As they swing about the pine
trees, parrot-fashion, with the help of their bill, calling out <i>kimp,
kimp</i>, that sounds like the snapping of the pine cones on a sunny day,
it often seems easily possible to catch them with the hand.</p>

<a name="WHITE-WINGED_CROSSBILL_221" id="WHITE-WINGED_CROSSBILL_221"></a>
<p>There is another species of crossbill, called the White-winged (<i>Loxia
leucoptera</i>), that differs from the preceding chiefly in having two
white bands across its wings and in being more rare.</p>

<p>"Ere long, amid the cold and powdery snow, as it were a fruit of the
season, will come twittering a flock of delicate crimson-tinged birds,
lesser redpolls, to sport and feed on the buds just ripe for them on
the sunny side of a wood, shaking down the powdery snow there in their
cheerful feeding, as if it were high midsummer to them." Thoreau's
beautiful description of these tiny winter visitors, which should be
read entire, shows the man in one of his most sympathetic, exalted
moods, and it is the best brief characterization of the redpoll that
we have.</p>

<p>When the arctic cold becomes too cruel for even the snowbirds and
crossbills to withstand, flocks of the sociable little redpolls flying
southward are the merest specks in the sullen, gray sky, when they can
be seen at all. So high do they keep that often they must pass above
our heads without our knowing it. First we see a quantity of tiny
dots, like a shake of pepper, in the cloud above, then the specks grow
larger and larger, and finally the birds seem to drop from the sky
upon some tall tree that they completely cover&mdash;a veritable cloudburst
of birds. Without pausing to rest after the long journey, down they
flutter into the weedy pastures with much cheerful twittering, to feed
upon whatever seeds may be protruding through the snow. Every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg_223]</a></span>
action of a flock seems to be concerted, as if some rigid
disciplinarian had drilled them, and yet no leader can be
distinguished in the merry company. When one flies, all fly; where one
feeds, all feed, and by some subtle telepathy all rise at the
identical instant from their feeding ground and cheerfully twitter in
concert where they all alight at once. They are more easily disturbed
than the goldfinches, that are often seen feeding with them in the
lowlands; nevertheless, they quite often venture into our gardens and
orchards, even in suburbs penetrated by the trolley-car.</p>

<p>Usually in winter we hear only their lisping call-note; but if the
birds linger late enough in the spring, when their "fancy lightly
turns to thoughts of love," a gleeful, canary-like song comes from the
naked branches, and we may know by it that the flock will soon
disappear for their nesting grounds in the northern forests.</p>

usually mistaken for each other.</p>

<p>In this "much be-sparrowed country" of ours familiarity is apt to
breed contempt for any bird that looks sparrowy, in which case one of
the most delicious songsters we have might easily be overlooked. It is
not until the purple finch reaches maturity in his second year that
his plumage takes on the raspberry-red tints that some ornithologists
named purple. Oriental purple is our magenta, it is true, but not a
raspberry shade. Before maturity, but for the yellow on his lower back
and throat, he and his mate alike suggest a song-sparrow; and it is
important to note their particularly heavy, rounded bills, with the
tufts of feathers at the base, and their forked tails, to name them
correctly. But the identification of the purple finch, after all,
depends quite as much upon his song as his color. In March, when
flocks of these birds come north, he has begun to sing a little; by
the beginning of May he is desperately in love, and sudden, joyous
peals of music from the elm or evergreen trees on the lawn enliven the
garden. How could his little brown lady-love fail to be impressed with
a suitor so gayly dressed, so tender and solicitous, so deliciously
sweet-voiced? With fuller, richer song than the warbling vireo's,
which Nuttall has said it resembles, a perfect ecstasy of love pours
incessantly from his throat during the early summer days. There is a
suggestion of the robin's love-song in his, but its copiousness,
variety, and rapidity give it a character all its own.</p>

<p>In some old, neglected hedge or low tree about the country-place a
flat, grassy nest, lined with horsehair, contains four or five green
eggs in June, and the old birds are devotion itself to each other, and
soon to their young, sparrowy brood.</p>

<p>But when parental duties are over, the finches leave our lawns and
gardens to join flocks of their own kind in more remote orchards or
woods, their favorite haunts. Their subdued warble may be heard during
October and later, as if the birds were humming to themselves.</p>

<p>Much is said of their fondness for fruit blossoms and tree buds, but
the truth is that noxious insects and seeds of grain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg_225]</a></span>
constitute their food in summer, the berries of evergreens in winter.
To a bird so gay of color, charming of voice, social, and trustful of
disposition, surely a few blossoms might be spared without grudging.</p>

<p>It seems almost superfluous to write a line of description about a
bird that is as familiar as a chicken; yet how can this nearest of our
bird neighbors be passed without a reference? Probably he was the very
first bird we learned to call by name.</p>

<p>The early English colonists, who had doubtless been brought up, like
the rest of us, on "The Babes in the Wood," named the bird after the
only heroes in that melancholy tale; but in reality the American robin
is a much larger bird than the English robin-redbreast and less
brilliantly colored. John Burroughs calls him, of all our birds, "the
most native and democratic."</p>

<p>How the robin dominates birddom with his strong, aggressive
personality! His voice rings out strong and clear in the early morning
chorus, and, more tenderly subdued at twilight, it still rises above
all the sleepy notes about him. Whether lightly tripping over the lawn
after the "early worm," or rising with his sharp, quick cry of alarm,
when startled, to his nest near by, every motion is decided, alert,
and free. No pensive hermit of the woods, like his cousins, the
thrushes, is this joyous vigorous "bird of the morning." Such a
presence is inspiriting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg_226]</a></span>
Does any bird excel the robin in the great variety of his vocal
expressions? Mr. Parkhurst, in his charming "Birds' Calendar,"
says he knows of "no other bird that is able to give so many
shades of meaning to a single note, running through the entire
gamut of its possible feelings. From the soft and mellow quality,
almost as coaxing as a dove's note, with which it encourages its
young when just out of the nest, the tone, with minute gradations,
becomes more vehement, and then harsh and with quickened
reiteration, until it expresses the greatest intensity of a bird's
emotions. Love, contentment, anxiety, exultation, rage&mdash;what
other bird can throw such multifarious meaning into its tone?
And herein the robin seems more nearly human than any of its
kind."</p>

<p>There is no one thing that attracts more birds about the house
<ins title='Correction: was "that"'>than</ins> a
drinking-dish&mdash;large enough for a bathtub as well; and certainly no
bird delights in sprinkling the water over his back more than a robin,
often aided in his ablutions by the spattering of the sparrows. But
see to it that this drinking-dish is well raised above the reach of
lurking cats.</p>

<p>While the robin is a famous splasher, his neatness stops there. A
robin's nest is notoriously dirty within, and so carelessly
constructed of weed-stalks, grass, and mud, that a heavy summer shower
brings more robins' nests to the ground than we like to contemplate.
The color of the eggs, as every one knows, has given their name to the
tint. Four is the number of eggs laid, and two broods are often reared
in the same nest.</p>

<p>Too much stress is laid on the mischief done by the robins in the
cherry trees and strawberry patches, and too little upon the quantity
of worms and insects they devour. Professor Treadwell, who
experimented upon some young robins kept in captivity, learned that
they ate sixty-eight earthworms daily&mdash;"that is, each bird ate
forty-one per cent. more than its own weight in twelve hours! The
length of these worms, if laid end to end, would be about fourteen
feet. Man, at this rate, would eat about seventy pounds of flesh a
day, and drink five or six gallons of water."</p>

<p>With a more southerly range than the Baltimore oriole and less
conspicuous coloring, the orchard oriole is not so familiar a bird in
many Northern States, where, nevertheless, it is quite common enough
to be classed among our would-be intimates. The orchard is not always
as close to the house as this bird cares to venture; he will pursue an
insect even to the piazza vines.</p>

<p>His song, says John Burroughs, is like scarlet, "strong, intense,
emphatic," but it is sweet and is more rapidly uttered than that of
others of the family. It is ended for the season early in July.</p>

<p>This oriole, too, builds a beautiful nest, not often pendent like the
Baltimore's, but securely placed in the fork of a sturdy fruit tree,
at a moderate height, and woven with skill and precision, like a
basket. When the dried grasses from one of these nests were stretched
and measured, all were found to be very nearly the same length,
showing to what pains the little weaver had gone to make the nest neat
and pliable, yet strong. Four cloudy-white eggs with dark-brown spots
are usually found in the nest in June.</p>

<p>With the exception of the correction detailed below, the text is a
transcription of the original printed book. Several minor corrections
were made where punctuation was missing (comma or period) or
formatting differed from that used for similar sections elsewhere.
Several forms of the verb travel appear with an alternative spelling
than is common in the present era. For example, travelled and
travelling are used. The book's images were moved so that
they are between the descriptive passages rather than interrupt the
"flow" of the text by just moving them between paragraphs as is
typically done.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
